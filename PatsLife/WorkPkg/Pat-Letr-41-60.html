<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! The sun is out for the first time in weeks and it’s wonderful.</p>
<p>Sorry I didn’t write – been busy here. The day Mr. Waters was buried, our neighbor and friend Mr. [Woodie] Lankford, had a heart attack. He was in intensive care for almost a week, died, and was buried Saturday. Walt was a pallbearer. It all happened so fast – he’d not been ill, was 63, retired because of a back injury – that it’s hard to adjust to. He was a lot of help to Walt with Walt’s building projects, etc. Matthew liked to go over there to visit the Langford‘s - so it’s sad – we’ve tried to help a little – cooked dinner one night, etc., But wish there was more we could do for Sybil his wife. I’m sure we can help out just by visiting, etc. – she loves the kids.</p>
<p>Walt’s folks were here for a few days – Bette will get her BS in engineering this spring and is looking for a job that might get her a transfer to Egypt. No comment. Nor will I comment on Karen except – well not even an exception. But I hope they are happy.</p>
<p>These kids drive me crazy – does this last forever? Only the first 20 years? Write soon. </p>
<p>Love, Pat.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Walt got the greenhouse finished – and it’s great!</p>
<p>We made it back home with not too much stress. The girls were sure glad to get here – then we all got sick – Walt was out of work for two days. Matthew missed two days of school. I didn’t get that sick so I had to do my work as usual.</p>
<p> Those outfits you gave Kate and Kris look really cute on them, Matthew likes his shirt, and my sweater keeps me nice and warm. Thank you.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Mike and Vi might move to Austin in June after the baby is born. Hopefully they do! Vi is thinking about delivering her baby at home – the hospitals are far away, and there are a lot of midwives up there. We are still looking forward to seeing you here – why don’t you come and celebrate your birthday (and mine) here. We are getting to where we need all the support(in other ways too) we can get. 
Write soon</p>
<p>
Love, Pat </p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We didn’t make it to Fort Worth as you may have noticed – many reasons – too hot – plumbing backed up, too much company last week (Bronstad came Saturday, left Tuesday a.m. – Birds came Tuesday a.m. left Thursday p.m.) We enjoyed all [of] it, but we’re glad to be just 5 again.</p>
<p>We have really enjoyed the waterbed.</p>
<p>Matthew finished his swimming – he enjoyed it and learned a lot – I need to take him swimming so he can practice.</p>
<p>The Christmas cactus, that I grew from a little cutting (it was huge) has begin losing big branches. I was so sad – my baby. Must’ve kept it too wet.</p>
<p>Kate has some kind of cold sores (herpes) in her mouth (a virus) (always something), didn’t eat for a week, and now for the first time weighs less than Kris.</p>
<p>There is something floating loose in my head that I was going to tell you, but I can’t remember what it was. I don’t even remember if it was important or not. Oh well. My sister (Margaret (Piggy) remembered that I was trying to find Victor coffee mugs – she found two and sent them with my mother – along with a great big bundle of barbecue ribs. Sammy is opening up his barbecue place on Sylvania, where Ashburn‘s ice cream used to be.</p>
<p>Can’t think of much else – how’s everyone there? and everyone not there?</p>
<p>Let us here – we may or may not come soon.</p>
<p>Love.<br>
Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I’ve had this clipping for a long time – we thought you might enjoy it.</p>
<p>Not much new around here – it’s hot! Muggy! And dry!</p>
<p>Philip goes to the park tomorrow – it’s the last day of summer school. We have decided to send him back to the same place for the next year. I think he’ll like it a lot better than the Montessori school where he’s been going. </p>
<p>The girls did not have any teeth yesterday. Kris has two and Kate one – and each has at least four more ready to pop out through any minute. Let me tell you it’s holy hell having two babies cutting 12 teeth all at one time. Help! They also can walk a few steps – or would until they stopped everything except crying – two days ago to work on their teeth.</p>
<p>Walt‘s been busy insulating the house – our fuel bills are out of sight.</p>
<p>Had a strange dream about Karen the other night.</p>
<p>How’s the landscape business? Tell me what it’s like going out every day. You think you could come some weekend soon? We’d like to see you!</p>
<p>We got the card about Sesame Street magazine. Thanks. </p>
<p>Love.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Finally, we got some rain – over 2 inches.</p>
<p>Not much else going on – just wanted to tell you that we will probably be in Fort Worth this week – end. We’ll come in late Friday night – leave Sunday. (Walt has started working on Mondays again –) I’ll call you Saturday – do you have plans for the weekend? I don’t know what hours will be but maybe we can come either Saturday p.m. or Sunday – if it’s OK.</p>
<p>Love, Pat.

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p> I found one T-shirt that would fit Julie – but none for Amy. I am still looking – but will get ones with decals already on them – cheaper than plain ones! – by two dollars!</p>
<p>We had a nice time at Phillips party , seven little kids at Zilker Park - nine counting Kate and Chris.</p>
<p>Kate is walking now has been for two or three weeks. Chris tries – she can walk four or five steps then gets so excited she falls. They are really at a cute age now – all smiles and goo-goos– a few words only a mother can decipher – plus “Mama“ “Dada”.</p>
<p>We still probably will come 16 October – and see you in the evening, but plans aren’t set yet. The monsters are ready for the juice now so had better close. </p>
<p>Say hello to the Waters [elderly next door family] and Rusty for us.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry it is taken so long to write.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed seeing you – may try that again soon.</p>
<p>The girls (and their mama and brother) like the cups and bowls you gave them - the only other bowl I had for them was the Raggedy Ann- Andy bowl you sent to Matthew.</p>
<p>Walt is painting the pink off the house – at last!</p>
<p>Matthew is getting ready for his Halloween party at school – wants to go as a ghost. Think I’ll take the girls in their stroller to enjoy the fun.</p>
<p>We got rid of the dog. it’s so nice to have a backyard again – I’ve been looking at garage sales for some yard furniture, but have had no luck so far.</p>
<p>Sure wish you guys could get down here sometime.</p>
<p>We talked to Mike and Vi Jurica about a week ago - they would like to leave their mountain retreat, but can’t afford to right now – I guess they feel trapped and I’m sorry – they had such great hopes for the ‘back to Nature’ thing but they‘re still young and will manage.</p>
<p>Philip Matthew was upset that Mike “ignored“ him said Mike didn’t say one word to him – and he was unhappy about that – but he looked he loved seeing Amy – got to go change two dirties.</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>
<p>[PS] Will get coat to Julie before cold.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving – we did – stuffed a turkey and ourselves. thanks for sending the clothes and toys – the toys went over big with all three kids. The Bronstad‘s plus Bette came for the day only – Bette was going to drive back by herself last night, but Clyde and Louise decided she couldn’t find her way home – so they went back too! Bette said that your girls are pretty and that Amy was especially sweet.</p>
<p>Loop When are you going to talk Mrs. Fox out of her car?</p>
<p>Matthew, of late, has spent hours every day drawing. he copies pictures of Santa Claus and reindeer out of the Christmas catalog – and can draw Spider-Man and Batman really well. He had a tiny little plastic skeleton which served as a model for one of his drawings. It’s really fun to see how well he does. Kate and Chris climb in and out and over everything – rearranging everything – and never stop. They are really at a cute age – wish I could keep them like this – you know – BL before language.</p>
<p>Did Jerry and Missy get their little girl?</p>
<p>Walt will be taking some time off at Christmas so if we screw up enough courage, we may come for several days.</p>
<p>Is Karen coming home? Not much else to say.</p>
<p>Hope you and Mike are doing OK – write soon</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Not much going on here. We really enjoyed the spots of nice weather – today looks like it will be great. Walt is in the process of enclosing the front porch with glass patio doors he bought very cheaply. Looks good.</p>
<p>I didn’t hear from any of those people you said might call. Wish you could come down now – when the weather is nice it’s really nice – warm, balmy, etc. How’s Rusty and wife doing? A few coupons enclosed. Write. Hello to Mike Julie Amy.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I found this unfinished letter in Matthew‘s room. Thought you might like to have it.</p>
<p>We were disappointed that you couldn’t come down – maybe in August you can. Bette got a job at the Corps of Engineers – she starts late, August. I think she wants to go on a trip to Canada first – take Louise, Clyde and Embrey with her.</p>
<p>We had an ice cream party for Alene Arriving and Jake – invited all the neighbors – Sunday night. It was a lot of fun – besides that we’re getting along as usual – boring –</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thought I’d better let you know why we didn’t stop by on our way out of town. Ky Ideology ris got sick – threw up right before Thanksgiving dinner – didn’t eat of course. She slept for a few hours and then we decided to leave. We are going to at least drop off Mike’s shoe trees, but she threw-up on the way over. So we just left! Good thing Julie decided not to ride back with us. Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving. Thanks for the calendar!</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>
<p>Kate home sick today!

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>It’s been raining here all day – and yesterday – I didn’t know there was so much rain! It is spring so I guess it’s usual, but it sure ruins a Sunday . </p>
<p>We are now the proud owners of a house and a car. We’ve had the car about three weeks (a red 81 Toyota Corolla) and I’m still not driving very often. These people drive on the other side of the road and when it comes time to make a right turn, I get totally confused. We move into our house on 5 December and are really looking forward to that. The house is very modern in design - (It’s about 10 years old) and is on a hillside – so while we don’t have a harbor view, we do have a terrific view of Karori. (one of these days we’ll take some pictures). It’s going to be hard to move though – the people next-door are just great. It’ll be sad to move away from Bryan and Pat. Pat and I run in the park every day – or did until she had a hysterectomy – so now I run with her dog Tina and await Pat’s return to the trail. </p>
<p>We are not moving very far away – the kids will still go to the same school – in fact, we can see the school from our new house.</p>
<p>The real estate lady who has sold us the house – and show us many others – invited me over to her house to meet her women friends, and her mother, (her husband is in the states on business right now). I had such a wonderful time – didn’t realize how much I missed gossip! The ladies talked about the Prime Minister‘s wife who didn’t (doesn’t) take care of him, the new Governor-General who’s part Māori, about well you know just junk, but I had missed that. I had a great time but had to watch the wine since it was the first time I had been out in the car by myself. I think the main reason Gillian invited me over was to see me in something besides jeans.(I don’t part with my past quickly). She seems satisfied that I did indeed have legs.</p>
<p>The kids get out of school end oh school year on 13 December. They seem to have adjusted very well and have quite a few friends. Matthew goes to the social for kids his age. (in the neighborhood) at the Anglican church every Friday night. Kate and Kris start swimming lessons on Monday as part of their school day. They are all looking forward to the end of the school parties.</p>
<p>Our address after December will be</p>
<p>15 Lynmouth Ave.</p>
<p>Karori;</p>
<p>Wellington 5</p>
<p>New Zealand</p>
<p>I am surprised at the number of succulent plants here – everywhere there are Christmas cactuses, donkey tails – and all kinds of cacti. Somehow, I didn’t expect that. Best wishes for Thanksgiving (not one here – but we may have a turkey dinner – if I can find a turkey)</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat .

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Well, another year gone – and I feel no wiser, do you?</p>
<p>It is summer now – early summer – and I’m finally beginning to believe it (my mind says Winter still). When the sun is out, it is just beautiful here – and I feel like a lizard crawling out to its warmth. It’s a little windy today. (it does get windy here – part of Wellington‘s charm which I may understand someday). It seems so unlike January – but then August didn’t seem like August either. One of these days my calendar will be in sync.</p>
<p>We love our house. It’s about 10 years old – and roomy, light, and warm. (It’s the first year we’ve had a fireplace to hang stockings by.) Walt is making a frame for a waterbed out of a native wood called Remu – it is very pretty and even put a headboard on it this time. he’s building the platform now, so hopefully we’ll be sleeping on it tonight. I finally got those oak chairs (the  ones we had in the kitchen) sanded and varnished. They look great.</p>
<p>We have a new cat – well not new, secondhand I guess. We met a family who is moving to Malaysia and couldn’t take their nine month old cat Toffee. So after checking us out, they decided Toffee could adopt us. He’s a real sweet cat and has quite a loud purr.</p>
<p>The kids are out of school until February 4. Kate and Kris will be in Standard 3 at Karori Normal and Matthew will be in Form 3 at Wellington College.</p>
<p>Walt rides his bike to work every day – it’s a little harder since we moved up to this hill. Running is harder too, but I’ve gotten back to it – run far enough so that I can walk back up the hill instead of running.</p>
<p>Christmas Day was quiet here, but we did have a nice day. We spent the afternoon at the Tyler‘s (our neighbors on Campbell Street) both our old neighbors (Tyler’s) and our new ones (Crumps) got the kids presents – nothing big, but I thought that was very nice. K & K & M thought it was wonderful, of course. We went to a Databank picnic the week before Christmas. Father Christmas arrived in a jeep with presents for all the kids. Then there was a party at Walt’s office and the kids were given another present! Walt gave me a green stone (native Jade) necklace –</p>
<p>Enclosed (I hope) are a couple of pictures. Thanks for the one of Amy. There is a shelf in our bedroom where I put all the pictures of family and friends. Why don’t you send one of you and Mike?</p>
<p>How are Rusty and his wife Lisa doing?</p>
<p>We are doing fine – we miss everyone though,</p>
<p>Love.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for remembering all of our dates (anniversary, etc.) if you will send me a list of yours (Mike’s birthday, your anniversary) I will add them to the calendar and maybe by some miracle I’ll remember to send cards. It is always nice to be remembered, isn’t it? </p>
<p>Life has become pretty routine around here. The kids are back in school – Matthew seems happy at Wellington college and the girls like being back at Karori normal. (I’m sorry if I repeat things – I forget who I’ve told what – I may have even told you that). The street here is full of little girls and K & K love it! They go from house to house to play – sometimes they all eat lunch here – sometimes in their clubhouse (a playhouse behind the Conway‘s house). Anyway, they have a ball – bicycling, skating, trampolining (lots of people have tramps here). I’ve been running – with Pat Tyler (our first neighbor) or by myself. I entered a fun run on Sunday and ran 9.5 km in 47 minutes 30 seconds. Not great, but I was very pleased with me. There is going to be a half marathon in June and I’ve been thinking about training for it. Probably won’t but it’s fun to think that it’s possible. </p>
<p>I’m gradually making a few good friends. This morning I’m going shopping with Sandy – a lady from England. She’s quite nice – has lived all over England, spent nine years in Singapore and a short while in New York. Now she and family are in New Zealand – her husband is Swiss and is the manager of a hotel here in Wellington (the best one). Also, we see the Gilman semi often. They moved here from Boston and have a boy Matthews age – Nathaniel – who also goes to Wellington College. Peg (mom) is OK and since we share a lot in common a lot of common experiences, we talk often – but she probably wouldn’t be one of my favorite people in the US. The Conway’s (across the street) are very nice. Marijka and Roger have three girls and they’re just a bit younger than we are. She’s lots of fun. I’ve been thinking about getting a part-time job or going to school (for what I don’t know.) I’m not in a hurry, but I do feel I’m ready to move on from the kitchen you know. If I stay home all day, I may have to clean the house or something just as boring. We’ll see.</p>
<p>David Humphrey (from Austin) finished his book about the history of Austin. It’s a big, beautiful well written book, which we were pleased to get – an autographed copy from for Christmas. It also got good reviews. Did you see it in the stores – or is it just in Austin – surely not.</p>
<p>We enjoyed the pictures you sent – anytime you have an extra – We’ll be happy to get one. We’ve been busy here at the house – putting trees, shrubs, etc., so I haven’t taken any pictures lately.</p>
<p>It’s been a pleasant summer here – although it’s still hard for me to think “summer“ and that next is Autumn. I guess it takes a few years.</p>
<p>I hope you’re all in good health and happy. Say hello to everyone. Love</p>
<p>Pat.</p>
<p>Do write!

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>We were sorry to hear about Mike’s mother. I hope things have settled down and you and Mike are feeling better. (Walt intends to write – but he hasn’t yet.”) Thanks for sending the newspaper article about her death. Was I wrong to feel that Mike’s dad should have been mentioned? After all, they spent many years together – it just seemed to me he should have been listed as a survivor or is this what modern living means?</p>
<p>I will change the subject now – but we do share your grief.</p>
<p>Life continues here – Autumn is not much different from summer – we still have beautiful sunny days, but on the days of the Southerlies (your norther) it is quite a bit colder. I’m so glad we have lots of windows facing north – the sun streams in all day And we are protected from the cold South winds by a wall and the garage door. We have planed it over 30 (small) trees. The people who lived here before us didn’t plant one tree. We’ve planted apple, pear, fig, a native rimu , a Puka (once a sacred Mori tree) several cabbage trees – (they are of the Lilly family and look a lot like a palm trees, a purple wattle that looks silvery. I got that for Walt for our silver anniversary) several (fern trees) and dozens of pheballium) to line the side of our section and protect us from some of the winds). Walt has been looking for a pecan tree  - also a walnut. It seems that every Saturday find us at a nursery, although we did get the cabbage trees and more free (someone was thinning out his grove).</p>
<p>We (rather the kids) are almost at the end of their first trimester. Matthew, who seems to enjoy Wellington college, had a whole series of test last week. He did best in Latin and French and science. Maths wasn’t as easy as he thought and the one in social sciences threw him for a loop – but not next time he’ll know more what to expect. He is on a soccer team, is trying to get on the cross country team, (running) and will start playing in a brass ensemble soon. He says he feels very much a “Yankee nerd“ (as some kids used to call him) but is feeling more part of the group. his best friend here is a boy from Western Samoa.</p>
<p>Walt went to a city (town) called Nelson in the South Island. He said it is very much like Taos, there are a lot of writers, artists, potters, Silversmith, etc. He really enjoyed being there – (databank has an office there – and Walt flew down for a few days, just to get an idea of the operation there). We all hope to go soon. Did I tell you we may get to come to the USA for Christmas in 87. After two years, Walt gets a month off (and addition to his regular vacation time) plus money (extra months salary) in the form of travel vouchers. So it looks like we can come and spend 4 - 6 weeks while the kids are on summer vacation.</p>
<p>Kate and Kris did enjoy the pictures of the cats that Amy sent (they are on the walls in their room). I’m sorry they didn’t say anything – but, they showed everyone in the neighborhood the pictures. They are still taking violin and cello lessons at Wellington High School – paid for by the city –. They are getting better but still have ups and downs about the whole thing.</p>
<p>We went to see (and hear) Carl Sagan at the University last week. Out of room and news. Hope to hear from you soon. </p>
<p>Love Pat.

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>Yesterday the Queen‘s birthday was celebrated in New Zealand – which meant that the kids and adults were home. I think that’s the last long weekend for Walt until October. We celebration the day by placing more trees. (I think we have put in over 50 now (30 of those are for a privacy fence in 5–8 years ) between our house and the one next-door. Houses here are quite close together and you either you either look into someone else’s lounge or kitchen. We are fortunate that we have quite a lot of privacy except one side – so that’s why we are putting a tree line on that side. Also we planted some feijoa (some exotic fruit) trees that do well in sun and wind. Our section looks quite a bit different than it did when we moved in – better we hope!</p>
<p>The kids are back in school for the second trimester. We go to Matthew school Thursday night for conference with his teachers. And on Saturday the 14th, we are invited to a party that the parents of one of the students in Matthew’s home room class is giving – just to get to know each other – sounds like a good idea to me since I don’t know any of the kids or parents. Since I work at Kris and Kate ‘s school library and kitchen, I have met, some of those parents. </p>
<p>We did enjoy our trip to Mount Taranaki - did you get the card? We had never seen such beautiful birds as we saw at a park in New Plymouth. I didn’t know anything so intensely colorful existed.</p>
<p>We also took a walk part of the way to the top of Mount Taranaki. Matthew Kate and Kris set the pace of our walk and what the book said would take 2 1/2 to 3 hours, took us 59 minutes 30 seconds. I think the vegetation was lovely but going so fast it was hard to see more than a blur. Kris said at one point in a very surprised voice, “you know I’m actually enjoying this.“ This from someone who usually drags at the rear claiming sore feet, aching head, etc. was pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Mary and Jimmy GIll my sister are coming to see us in January. We are looking forward to that. I think we can come there for Christmas 87 – anyway, we hope so after Walt has worked at Data Bank two years, he gets an extra month’s salary and travel vouchers each year. I don’t know what the travel vouchers actually cover, but we (me) are hoping we can swing it - visit Fort Worth, Austin and Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Well, how are you all doing? It seems strange that it’s summer. There are strange that it’s not summer here after all it is June! Did Julie graduate? Did you visit Austin? Did you miss us? We miss having good friends come for the weekend.</p>
<p>I don’t understand what embarrassed you about writing down your birthdays and anniversaries(?) Did you ever see Jerry and Missy? Karen? Rusty? How is he doing with the new wife? With the old wives? I’m working on these needlepoint covers for our dining room chairs – I’m almost finished with the first one – only three to go! Must go – hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I wonder when we will begin to associate winter with July! It’s not really freezing cold weather – I think there’s only been one morning below 32°F – but when the Southerlies blow and the rain comes down for days at a time, I think a nice quiet snowstorm would be nice. We do have wonderful views of winter though – in the distance are snow covered mountains [ Remutakas] that can be seen on sunny warm days like today. The warmer days of winter are wonderful and probably outnumbered the rainy cold ones.</p>
<p>Did you have a July 4 party? We had some friends (Argentinians and New Zealanders) over for dinner; I did serve apple pie. It was not really a celebration of independence, just sort of happened on that date.</p>
<p>We haven’t been doing anything exciting lately. I’ve been halfheartedly looking for a part-time job. I’ll either get a job – or go back to school. I’m not highly motivated at the present time, but I am trying a special semester at Victoria University in a couple of weeks[-] will rekindle old fires (they may be out by now). Speaking of fires we finally have a house with a fireplace – but it’s more for show than heat (a black freestanding designer one) so we have been looking at more efficient wood heaters – that also looked halfway decent. And we ran across a lady originally from Boston (she married a New Zealander 20 years ago) publishes a paper called “Energy Watch“. We went there to look at a stove “ugly as sin“ they were selling and then started talking about solar energy. She “Molly“ and her husband [a nuclear engineer, educated at UCLA) insisted we stay for lunch we -spent the whole afternoon with them – talking of this and that – they had wonderful books. It was very nice – and the children sat around reading books and petting cats.</p>
<p>Will and Matthew went fishing Sunday – some guys from Walt’s office rented a fishing boat and captain for the day – Matthew caught a shark! We learned later that there are lots of sharks around and that’s the kind of fish in the fish and chips chops. Matthew found out that he’s not wild about fishing – but did enjoy being out in Cook Straight for the day – it was a wonderful sunny and calm day. Chris Kate and I elected not to go. We stayed home and the girls baked and frosted the cake with very little supervision for me.</p>
<p>Tonight we go to Wellington College – on stage of production put on by mats school he will usher.</p>
<p>I’ve been having trouble when running with my knees – finally had it x-rayed, which showed no abnormalities. So this a.m. I went to a sports Doctor Who said I have stretched a ligament and that my knee – cap is slipping – now I go to the physical therapist for treatments, take anti-inflammatory pills for 10 days, rub a medicated cream on my knee and then will have to have special inserts in my shoes – and it’s all for free – can you believe it? All personal injuries are covered under the Accident Compensation Corporation. I sure have missed running these last three weeks and will be glad to start again soon.
Walt and I go to take our written driving test next week – God I hate test! (Guess I better not go back to school) and already have sweaty palms just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the pictures – one of these days we’ll have more. I did remember Matthew‘s class picture. Matt hates this picture – says he looks fat – he’s not. Kate and Chris won’t have their’s  taken until October.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We hope you had a nice Christmas. Did Santa Claus come? We had a visit not only from father Christmas, but also Mary and Jimmy. We had a really good time. We met him up at Lake Taupo (about 250 miles from Wellington) on Tuesday before Christmas. They belong to an international timeshare thingy, so we had a lovely five days with great views, indoor pool – spa, etc. – all very unlike New Zealand, but the Americans love it. We saw lots of geysers, bubbling, mud, pits, Volcanic lakes, waterfalls, and lots of native woods (or bush as it’s called here). We walked a lot, swam, ate turkey for dinner (also pecan pie) and talked. When we headed back to Wellington for another week of sightseeing, we took them to our favorite place, saw a New Zealand movie cartoon ate at a wonderful restaurant, made homemade ice cream – and on and on. One thing we did was to take the ferry across the  Cook Straight to see the south island. It was a three and one a half hour trip there and the scenery was wonderful – the Marlborough Sounds are quite spectacular. And it was a beautiful sunny day. Except for a day or two the weather was great the whole time Mary and Jimmy were here (I don’t think they realized how lucky they were – it is very early summer and the weather can be quite cold wet– but it wasn’t too bad at all. One day was very, very windy.)</p>
<p>Now they are gone and we are getting back to normal.</p>
<p>For Christmas. Walt gave me a beautiful wooden bowl. It was made by an Auckland artist out of native Totara. Now I need to find a good place to show it off. (Did you get the seeds we sent? I hope they germinate.) Matthew Kate and Chris at the age were clothes delight them so that’s what they got. Kate and Kris squealed with delight when they saw their much coveted Adidas track pants under the tree, they were still not “into“ dresses, but have definite opinions about what kind of sweatshirts they should have! Walt got a sweater from me a New Zealand wool of course. Mary and Jimmy bought us a suitcase full of things, vanilla, Pace Picante sauce, Reese‘s peanut butter, cups, pencil, sharpeners, and pencils that actually have erasers on the top! It was a real treasure trove.</p>
<p>Did you have Julie home for the holidays?</p>
<p>The kids don’t go back to school until 1 February and I don’t go until 1 March. I’m already ready to go. Pet Tyler the lady I run with, has a friend who just finished her first year at law school, and Pat is going to have us both over for coffee to talk about what I can expect. The lady, Chris, also said she would bring her papers from her classes so that I could read them. I thought that was awfully nice – and since I’ve been out of school for ever will be a big help.</p>
<p>We are all doing well– and hope you are too. Please write soon</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat </p>
<p>PS I ran over 550 miles last year – but not all at once.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We got the package yesterday. It’s too late for the Christmas decorations – anyway, we didn’t decorate a tree this year) took a small one to Lake Taupo which we decorated with Christmas crackers. (I’ll bring you some right next Christmas)) but the kids did like them. And what a wonderful book I’m on page 143 – and read Walt the good parts (I love the story of Leon and Roman). We miss hearing “Prairie Home Companion“. We were semi – regulars listeners. We always wish they were on at a different time. (I think I was it was 9 o’clock on Saturday nights. In Fort Worth. It’s around six isn’t it?) Anyway it’s really nice to read the book– ( I love Garrison‘s voice)</p>
<p>It’s been hot and sunny and dry the past few weeks (only 77°F, but somehow it’s hot here.)</p>
<p>Got a letter from an old friend (from Ann Arbor)) who is getting married again January 31 and then he and his wife are moving to Japan. Wonder if they’ll drop in since we share the same ocean. his son who was in fourth grade when we knew them, has now graduated from college and is a reporter in DC. Where does the time go? What are your and Mike’s plans once Amy has left? We have years left. Probably seven or eight at least. I know once it’s gone, it will have  seemed to be quick but on days when all three are teasing each other it seems eternities away.</p>
<p>Must go now – Hope you enjoy the pictures.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>At K and K’s school individual pictures are taken every other year – so you’ll have to wait for those.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Finally, it has rained. It was quite dry here – fire bans, on barbecues, rubbish, burning, etc. Sometimes it does get dry toward March and the fire danger is great because of the wind, but this year started out dry. Anyway, we had a lot of hot, dry weather – enough so that I was glad to see it end. </p>
<p>Thank you for the birthday card; hope you got the one we sent you. Did you have a nice birthday. I did. Walt’s mother called (I can remember when that wouldn’t have seems so special) and so did Walt’s brother. Walt gave me a beautiful leather satchel – I think he’s trying to tell me something! – For school. Unfortunately another year came with the day too!</p>
<p>I finished reading Lake Woebegone Days and enjoyed it – it was great fun wasn’t it? I’ve loaned it to a friend a friend‘s mother (American) who misses hearing the program on Saturday nights – she’s even been to the broadcast – says you need to get tickets four months in advance.</p>
<p>The kids are back in school have been since the first of this month. Kris was home today because of an earache. Kate missed eating lunch with Kris, but at least she went on to school without a fuss. I remember in the past, having to promise, the one who is not sick the moon practically before she would go on to school. Music lessons begin this Saturday. Kate still plays the cello; Kris the violin. Matthew is taking French horn lessons at his school – and is supposed to be checking on how to get in the orchestra, but unless someone comes up to him and gives him an engraved invitation, he probably won’t be in it. What a kid! we liked hearing about the seeds – what a good idea to take them to the botanical gardens. If you need some more, let me know. Walt keeps putting in more trees here. Recently, he added a tulip tree and a Babaco. We’ve played 50 (small) trees and so far more have died – Will  dead but the nursery replaced it. Can you believe the owner of the nursery came out to the house to check the tree – wanted to see why it died – it was an Australian water tree, which was replaced – but the replacement is not too happy either – must be the location.</p>
<p>I think when it finally expires, we put in a native palm tree. It would look good in front of the white wall. Are you getting excited about the wedding? Wish we could come.</p>
<p>By the way – when you send a package, you can count it taking two months, unless it’s mail which cost a fortune. The deadline for mailing packages to arrive at Christmas time is something like October 20. I don’t know what “class“ means just tell him you want to send it “surface” – that is if you mail me again. is Amy getting excited about graduation? What will you do when she leaves? When it seems strange – maybe a few more cats? I love that article you sent. Some days I can’t wait</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>PS I had a small cyst removed from my face last week – don’t know if you’ll notice it but I’m so glad I haven’t gone said she wouldn’t even bother to have a biopsy done since it was obviously just a fatty deposit.
