<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>What do you mean – “thanks for the short note“ – that was a letter – a long one. Everyone is asleep around here – Walt works all night, so, of course, he’s sleeping. Philip finally ran out of steam and pooped out on the couch. If I could find a convenient place, I join them. </p>
<p>We will be leaving here Wednesday morning – early I hope. We’ll stop at a friends house in Memphis, then at my sister’s in Roanoke (she and Family just moved there from Washington DC – my little sister,Betty, who I haven’t seen in about four years. Then we’ll head for Fort Worth. We haven’t told the Bronstads the date yet, but I did tell them that we wouldn’t spend all of our time with them – that we’d spend time with other relatives and friends – they weren’t too happy, but said they understood.</p>
<p>Is that house across from you still for sale? We want to look at it even though nothing has been decided as far as moving away from here. But you can never tell! I’d really like to move there, but don’t know if the reasons I give, all the real ones – maybe I’m running away from something here – who knows. My mind these days does double somersaults constantly.</p>
<p>I am really glad I called and talked to you and Mike – made me feel better – for a while – then great doubts and clouds started festering again – maybe I’m the one who should be in therapy. I read a book the other day about this totally in perceptive, completely selfish person who had no idea that she was in perceptive and selfish – she thought she was really understanding and a great judge of people and and and – and. I just got to thinking - not for the first time – that perhaps that’s me – causing chaos wherever I go. Hurting people and not even being aware of it. If that’s me, I would like to change - but how do I go about it – clouds, clouds festering. Oh shit! I never even told Walt I called you - I said too many things that I didn’t want to repeat to him. I do have a tendency to say too much about other peoples confidences.</p>
<p>Anyway – see you soon. is this a short note?</p>
<p>Love, Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Glad to hear your garden is growing well if it ever gets warm around here, we are going to plant one up the street and around the corner at the home of the parents of the little girl I babysit. They have 3 acres and we’re happy to share the land. It’s close enough that we can just hop on our bikes ( <u>got</u> a seat for Philip.) and be there in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Because of complications, I’ve only been to counseling (within clinic) twice so there’s not much to say about that – although the counselor did say that I don’t seem to know what I want out of marriage – how do you tell someone in a 1 – 2–3 formula what do you want. I only know that this is not what I want – at least the way it is – and Walt still says he really doesn’t want to commit himself to a monogamous pairing. Well, fuck them all. I want at least that – is that an unreasonable request? Is that being very possessive? I just can’t trust Walt and without trust there’s not really much to build on. She also says that I’m not as confused as I like to think I am – that I’m just scared to think of divorce. your comments, please</p>
<p>
Love. Pat

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p> I thought you would have written by now – I guess I expect you to write too often? I’ve been feeling really good lately – toward Walt and most importantly toward me. I hope I haven’t worried you too much. It was really comforting having you to talk to, to write to when I needed to. I have been unfair to Walt –  blaming him for a lot of things – but not really telling him what I expect, what I want, etc. My counselor says nobody can read another person‘s mind – this all may so simple to you – but I’m really learning a lot of things – about me. Anyway, I hope I haven’t altered the way you think of Walt – I really think he’s a great guy – a little screwed up maybe – but we all are. But I think we can make it – both doing what we want (to a certain extent!) but not being forced to do something that really hurts me or him (not too clear but you know what I mean – or do you – let me know - can’t assume what you know) Here’s hoping! You know you mentioned how sad you are – why not sit down and write – I’ll listen and you’ll feel better sound familiar?</p>
<p>Love, Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I’m glad you liked the robe. You waited long enough for it! I’ve become a hooker since I last wrote. I’m referring to rugs, of course – I’m doing an Alaskan owl which when finished, will hang on a wall, not lay on the floor. It’s fun and easy and I hope to get into making my own designs, dying, and cutting my own wool, etc. Then it will really be exciting. </p>
<p>As this moment, we do plan on selling our house and moving back to Fort Worth. Depends on when whoever buys this place – if anyone does – want to move in. Does Mike’s mother sell real estate? If she does, do you think she could help us find a place – if she is willing, we can call her and give her an idea of what we want, the area, and the price. Would you check that out for us please.</p>
<p>Walt has been working as a nurses aid the last few weeks at a convalescent home – he likes it.</p>
<p>We went to the zoo today – it was fun, but really too hot. All the animals were hidden in various cool places so it was impossible to see most of the animals. See you soon – I hope you still have plenty of time to write.</p>
<p> Love Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Just had a very discouraging talk with our realtor – she just can’t seem to sell this house – it’s been advertised in the papers – no calls – people look at it and like it but not the neighborhood – the bank wants 25% down With 11% interest. So it looks like we will be here for a while. We did so want to get out of here before winter – but I guess we’ll make the best of it.</p>
<p>Friday, we are leaving for a week – going to Taos, N. M. Some friends are moving there and they want to go down first to buy some land – they asked us to go and make it a camping trip – so it won’t cost very much. We’ll go through Denver, Colorado – I’ve always wanted to go there. These friends are Mike and Vi – Mike is the one who disappeared for a week. Seems he took off – got to Taos, decided that’s where he wanted to live – with his wife and child. So he headed back, drove straight through without stopping because he was so afraid Vi would be gone – hoping she’d still be there. She was, so all is fine. I feel really good about those two now and also glad that I was able to help during their “crisis “. I know I’m bragging, but I feel so good that I was able to keep Vi from really making a lot of drastic decisions while Mike was gone. Pat, Pat, Pat. [patting self on back] Oh well, we all need to feel extra good inside sometimes.</p>
<p>Philip is really getting to be a person talks all the time, is getting potty trained (sometimes)</p>
<p>Walt is getting tired of his job and wants to head for Texas more than he has for a while, I think the trip to Taos will be good for us all. Love to all</p>
<p>Pat   Write!

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thank you for the shirt and the cute Raggedy Andy; Philip really liked it. He laughed and he hugged it. I put it on the shelf in his room.</p>
<p>We didn’t go to Taos – all four of us decided that there were too many things to be done here – like selling houses and cars (theirs). The Juricas hope to get rid of a lot of “earthly“ possessions and head to Taos to live – they plan on building an Adobe house there – almost wish we were joining them.</p>
<p>We’ve still had no luck with the house – mortgage money just isn’t very available right now. I really never thought that we could get stuck with this house – it’s a lovely little place with about a half acre filled with trees over 50 feet tall – oak, walnut, chokecherries, maples, etc. But the right people with the right money just haven’t come along. It’s very depressing at times.</p>
<p>And now I have a horrible head cold – my nose hurts, my eyes hurt, am I cheering you. I liked Eric Severide’s comments last night – after Jerry Ford‘s press conference – that the Ford administration had gotten off to a running stop.</p>
<p>Philip talks all the time – making sentences and demands like a machine gun. the other morning, I asked him if he wanted to potty; he said, “no, I want to pee on mama. “Very funny kid – except that at the time he was saying it, he was doing just that.</p>
<p>How‘s Mike these days? I wish we were there – I think I could help him in his land – scaping ventures – or it must be just wishful thinking, but I do have lots of ideas.</p>
<p>Love to you all, please write.</p>
<p>Pat </p>
<p>Happy birthday to Amy – sorry I never remember their birthdays write them down for me. I know yours, so give me Amy’s, 
Julie‘s and Mike’s.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Walt’s parents were here for a visit – just left yesterday. We enjoyed having them here; I turned his mom onto rug hooking. I am washing and cutting the wool for her pattern now. It’s fun. By the way, save all the old flannel wool, like 50 cent of skirt, church sales, garage sales cheap you can get. It’s much cheaper to prepare the wool yourself than buying it already prepared. Then not only do you save money, you can dye the colors you want. And it’s really exciting to do the whole thing. Louise and I are going to buy a cutting machine (cut wool strips for hooking) so we all should be set to have a relatively cheap hobby. I thought I would get you a needle and a hook – unless you have a large one with the screw adjustment let me know.</p>
<p>We have our house for sale – so far only one family has looked – and we haven’t heard again from them. Whenever we can unload it, we will be down. No, you and Mike did not unduly influence us. Of course, we will be delighted to be living close to you again, but it’s just that there is really no reason to stay here any longer and we would like Philip to know his relatives. I think kids miss a lot if they grow up not being part of an extended family. I have really fond memories of my grandmother – and assorted aunts and uncles – Walt too – and we would like for Philip to have the same kind of relationships that were important to us.</p>
<p> Walt too worries about his folks – they are getting old – anyway, you are a reason we are moving back but not the. Feel better? Or worse?</p>
<p>Also, when I get there, I want to get a kiln and make pottery.</p>
<p>We would like a house on the east side, a big one with a fireplace – an older house on a large lot with lots of trees – big rooms, a house, not unlike yours. the price can vary from 15,000 to 25,000 – cause we’ll have the money from this house to invest – maybe even as high as 30,000 if it’s a wonderful old thing we just can’t pass up. You might look around but I have no idea when we’ll come – depends on when we sell this. if you see something you know we’d love – call us right away. Big kitchen lots of windows lots of light.</p>
<p>Do write – hope you enjoy the pictures. Let me know about hoop. </p>
<p>Remember about wool – flannel</p>
<p>Love </p>
<p>Pat, Walt and Phillips send their love too.

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>I made the cutest little robe for Amy from face towels – now I’m in the process of making one for Julie – but the hand towels are too small and the bath towels too large - will you measure her from her neck to her toes and around her chest – and send them quickly? I’d like to finish it and get them both in the mail. </p>
<p>We are slowly getting things ready to move – very slowly as Phillips says “may slow slow“. It doesn’t seem real to us either – but if we stay here longer than December 1, we will have to stay in our tent and – and that’s pretty real. Send me the measurements soon.</p>
<p>Love.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We finally got some stamps. I got the letter from Julie – it sounded as if she enjoyed camp; did she?</p>
<p>We’ve been sort of busy looking for a house – things cost more here it seems – especially rent and houses. we haven’t found anything yet – a couple of things we like – one really old that we can’t get financed and one fairly old one 1/2 acre that’s too expensive. So we’ll keep looking.</p>
<p>Karen and Bud were here [100 B Florence, Austin, TX. 78753] this weekend – we really enjoyed seeing them. We keep expecting to see some of your guys – and tell Rusty he owes me about $120 now and he better get started saving very soon. Our phone number is 1–512–837–0566</p>
<p>It’s very hot and humid here – the air conditioners don’t work. Phillips seems to like it here – there’s a little boy next-door to play with – also one very big white dog and two little black puppies. Plus our cats which he harasses continuously</p>
<p>It’s starting to rain – the third day in a row it’s OK though it’s the only time it’s cool</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for the birthday cards – we’ve had ice cream, cake, presents, guest, etc. All birthday week – this week will be rather quiet. The Bronstad’s were here for a few days to help celebrate. We went to the park and to the LBJ library – to my surprise it was really a pleasure to visit. They had wonderful gifts given to Johnson by the really rich or important) on display. I’ve never seen such a beautiful things. </p>
<p>We still haven’t heard about the loan – should hear this week. How is everyone there? Did you have a plant sale? The lady across the street had one – I went – she gave me two tiny trees – seedlings from one someone had brought from Africa. It grows into a huge, beautiful tree – hope my little ones survive. Be sure to tell the Waters hello for us. And do write. I miss hearing from and about you.</p>
<p>Love, Pat

Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry I didn’t talk to you last night – I was caught by surprise by the phone and wasn’t thinking straight. I wanted to talk to you about plans for Christmas. We are leaving here after Walt gets off work Wednesday – about 3:30 – I don’t know what time we’ll arrive – hope the traffic isn’t too bad. Are you having an open house like last year? My family thing is Christmas Eve so I don’t know if we’ll be able to see you that day, but will try. I have some presents – some my mother has - the necklaces for Julie and Amy – she says they’re really cute. We are spending little this year, but I always splurge on a few kids – yours included. I hope you don’t mind – I love doing it. Don’t tell her, but I got Amy the cutest ragdoll – if she doesn’t like it, I’ll keep it.</p>
<p>We’ll come over Christmas Day – will you be there? I’d love to call you now, but our phone bill – with the transfer calls – will be astronomical. That’s about all – we are looking forward to seeing you. Tell Rusty and Carol congratulations – hope we get to see them. I promised Philip I’d take him to see Santa Claus today so I better get busy.</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>
<p>{ PS } something funny – Philip’s little friend was here the other day – his name is Matthew. Philip’s decided he wanted to be called Matthew too. I said “if you’re both Matthew, how can I tell you apart?“ Wise old  Philip said, “well, I don’t come apart! “

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I went to an estate sale Saturday and found you the yellow bowl you’ve been looking for – for two dollars. I bought it and will give it to you the next time I see you.</p>
<p>We are all fine – been hot and going swimming , see you one of these days.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p> We really did have a great time in New Mexico – snow and mountains were beautiful. It was, of course, nice to see Mike and Vi again. They really love it there – and work hard. They are redoing a really old adobe house – mud walls, stone floors, added, two rooms, etc. – as they say – they’ve worked their asses off. But the view they have – wow! </p>
<p>Thank you for Oscar - Philip really enjoys putting it together – he doesn’t faster than I.</p>
<p>Walt has been insulating the ceiling – hope it saves on our heating bill.</p>
<p>I don’t know when we will come to Fort Worth – It’s so nice to be here after the busy Christmas trips. Why don’t you come here for our birthdays? I think that’s an excellent suggestion. You could just relax – after all, you will be 34!</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat

<p>Happy birthday, Eve.</p>
<p>I spent several hours looking for a card appropriate of the occasion and was not satisfied with any – so I’ll write my own clever, combining the sticky sweetness of some, the light humor of the others, the biting sarcasm was still others – keeping in mind, of course, the special – Ness of the day, The age of the person involved, the year it happened, never forgetting the trust you placing me, and of course, the family members involved, the age of Aquarius and the former president. Guess since I’ve run out of room, you’ll have to wait till next year for a card.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thank you for those pictures you gave Philip – he likes them – calls one Sad Eyes, the other Happy Eyes. Walt’s mother and dad came down for the birthdays – they stayed about five days –</p>
<p>We’ve finally gotten some much-needed rain and the weather is gloriously cool. </p>
<p>I’m doing OK – gained too much weight this month – but have only one to go. I’ll never be so happy to see a month end – I miss my waist and being able to bend there.</p>
<p>Well, let us know how you are doing – we won’t be in Fort Worth for a while, you know.</p>
<p>You are welcome here whenever you can come, but, of course, you know that. Thanks again for the paintings.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry we didn’t get back by there Sunday – Walt went to a garage sale that morning, bought an attic fan, and spent the rest of the day taking it apart to get it, us, and my mom in the car. by the time he was ready, the rest of us were impatient to go – by the time we got to Cranfills Gap – the flea market was closed!!</p>
<p>I thought you might be interested in this second article about Lon’s book.</p>
<p>It was nice to meet your friends after hearing About them for so long.</p>
<p>Love, Pat

<p>Dear Eve, Walt forgot to leave the picture with you – Kate is on the left – it was taken last week.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clothes – we appreciate them.</p>
<p>Walt said you had seen both Karen and Rusty – how are they doing? We are all the same. Philip is going to school this summer – today they go to the park for a day of swimming and play. he doesn’t seem to enjoy it as much as the school he went to last fall and spring but he’s beginning to make several friends there – including his “favorite girlfriend”.</p>
<p>Sure wish you could come for a visit – do you think you could. I know we all could come to Fort Worth but with these little babies, it sounds like cruel and then usual punishment.</p>
<p>My mother was here for a couple of weeks. God – this is a boring letter – tell me if it’s better not to write at all. Write and tell me about what’s going on there. </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for sending those clothes and the pictures of Julie - her haircut makes her even prettier.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard from Rusty? We haven’t.</p>
<p>School’s out and Matthew is already lonely – but a few kids from his school will visit over the summer and he’ll visit them. He’s sleeping late this morning – it’s 8:15!</p>
<p>The girls are crawling, standing up, and getting into everything. I thought I’d have more time once they started getting around on their own – but that’s a laugh.</p>
<p> I hope you get to visit soon. My mom is coming sometime this month and I’m sure the Bronstads will make her monthly trip.</p>
<p>We all went out to eat the other day – pizza – and everyone was on their best behavior. It seems the worst time around here is between 5 and 7 – if we could do away with that time of day, it would be great.</p>
<p>What are your plans for the summer?</p>
<p>My niece Carolyn, mother of Jeremy, had another little boy last week – Joshua. Not a very interesting letter, but thought since I had a few minutes – and couldn’t face another dirty diaper – I’d write.</p>
<p>Tell everyone hello and all right?</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>
<p>Betty, John, Tracy and Aaron are moving to Kerrville in August. My Christmas cactus is blooming.
