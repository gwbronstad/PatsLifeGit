<h1>Pat's Life; a Memoire in Photos</h1>
<h2>Retirement</h2>
<article class="center">
<p>This work, a Memoire in Photos, is largely a photo essay. For much of Pat's life, I have few or no photos.</p>
<p>There are no pictures of her volunteer work with "Meals on Wheels". It would have been questionable, if not unethical to have any photos of her clients.</p>
<p>Similarly few photos of her running, or fostering owl houses, or backyard wildlife habitat, or maintaining work friendships.  </p>
<p>But pictures of travel, I do have.

    <h1>North America</h1>
    <p>Patricia and I travelled a bit when the children were with us. Retirement made travel arrangements easier when there were just the schedules of two people to consider.</p>
    <p>There is so much to see on our continent; a German friend we met in Mexico, J&ouml;rg showed us how little we were aware. J&ouml;rg, with the thoroughness of a German electrical engineer planned to show Americans the America we were never likely to see. And that he did.</p>

Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the early 15th century. The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or Prague Bridge (Pražský most), but has been referred to as "Charles Bridge" since 1870.</p>

The region of Sápmi was formerly known as Lapland, and the Sámi have historically been known in English as Lapps or Laplanders, but these terms are regarded as offensive by the Sámi, who prefer the area's name in their own languages, e.g. Northern Sámi Sápmi. Their traditional languages are the Sámi languages, which are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the Sámi have pursued a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping, and sheep herding. Their best-known means of livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. As of 2007 about 10% of the Sámi were connected to reindeer herding, which provides them with meat, fur, and transportation; around 2,800 Sámi people were actively involved in reindeer herding on a full-time basis in Norway. For traditional, environmental, cultural, and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved for only Sámi in some regions of the Nordic countries. </p>
