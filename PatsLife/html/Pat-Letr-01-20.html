    <p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>We are alive at 802 South Locust, apartment 6M, Champaign, Illinois, 61820. I asked Walt if he had anything special to say – he said, ask for money.</p>
<p>After leaving Fort Worth, we went to Wisconsin, then to Champaign, where we’ll be encamped for seven more weeks. The climate here is terrible - it has already rained in the two weeks. We’ve been here – more than El Paso sees in three years. The rain I don’t mind, it’s just the jungle heat – never thought I’d miss the Sun City barf. </p>
<p>Did you know that Mickey Mouse wears a Spiro Agnew wrist watch? </p>
<p>I hope you are all there well.</p>
<p>We left Blacky and Brownie to spend the summer in Fort Worth, and brought only Chewy with us.</p> 
<p>Walt’s growing a beard - how did you ever adjust to a beard, Eve? Does it ever get softer? </p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon. Our telephone number is 356–372 in case you get an urge to call.</p>
<p>Love. Pat.</p>

<div class="grid-item"><p>Pat read books while Walt took preparatory classes at the University of Illinois, prior to one more go at Michigan. Walt was freshly discharged from the Army; he took an early out from the Army for the purpose of going to graduate school. Cutting his enlistment short by two months may have been more important than graduate school. The Viet Nam war had grown more and more objectionable; that Richard M Nixon had ascended to the top of the Chain of Command was simply intolerable. </p></div>

<p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>I hope you’re still at this address – it’s been so long since I’ve written, It’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>Haven’t written cause things stay the same around here. Walt goes to school, I go to work; on the weekends, we drink beer and talk about the studies and the work done during the week. Not very exciting. But we are both glad to be in Ann Arbor – and, good God sometimes we even miss El Paso. </p>
<p>How’s Mike’s progress? Are you in school?</p>
<p>I wish you didn’t have the bad habit of writing only when you’re written to. That’s not fair. How are we supposed to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>We have Chewy and Brownie with us (Blackie’s with the Bronstad‘s). Chewy and Browne get along beautifully together since Browns been “fixed.“ Only thing is that his hair is fallen out in big splotches. Where he has hair, it’s long and shiny, but baldness really doesn’t become him.</p>
<p>We are very, very close to buying a small house of a friend who is leaving. It’s really just a winterized lake cottage on Whitmore Lake (exactly 9.4 miles from campus). It has two bedrooms and looks sort of like this [illustration] Makes your house on Signal Peak [El Paso] look big. Has a dark room in the basement. Has a garage and a nice sized (?) (big compared to house) corner lot with lots of trees – on a lake where swimming, fishing, etc. is allowed.</p>
<p>So if the deal goes through, we cut payments from $150 (rent) to $50 (house payments). Sounds great to us – and no neighbors attacking our eardrums 24 hours a day. {of course though we will have a loan payment of $60 a month, but it’s still cheaper}</p>
<p>Please do write and tell us what’s going on – how the kids are, etc.</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>

 <div class="grid-item"><p>Pat had gotten a job at Parke-Davis, a pharmaceutical company. The two of us were living in an apartment (351 B Longshore Dr) in Ann Arbor. Two students Walt had known in 1963 and 1964, Jim and Linda Lee Taylor lived at 362 Grove, Whitmore Lake. Jim had a post doc in London, so the two wanted to travel light and sell out.</p></div>

<p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>We didn’t have enough animals before, so we acquired two more. A huge dog and an almost as huge cat came with the house we bought. Boo the dog, is not a very good watchdog, but she really attacks the scraps from the table and any crumbs she finds while she’s running around the house ant-eater style. Pi can’t get used to being the cat around here. She only comes around at meal time and she eats very fast, grumbling the whole time.</p>
<p>We’ve been here almost 2 weeks now – have planted even more flowers. The tulips, violets, hyacinth, and daffodils are in bloom, it is really quiet and peaceful here though we hardly been around much. We just got back from Washington. [D. C.]</p>
<p>The mood there this time was very subdued, almost apathetic. I guess no one really had any confidence that the protest would do any good, but just couldn’t think of any other method. We came away more depressed than ever.</p>
<p>The primary in Texas was really a shock – though I guess it shouldn’t have been. It sounds as if Michigan will be just as well represented as you – I have a real fear that Mrs. Romney will win over Senator Hart. Add her to Griffin – and Gerald Ford – now I’m really depressed!</p>
<p>Right to tell us how you’re doing, etc. </p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>
<p>Walt says hello.</p>

<div class="grid-item"><p>So we bought the house; the dog, Boo, conveyed with it. A shaggy, needy dog that could  have used shearing, but Jim and Linda let Boo confront the cold in her dog house, so wwe like they would leave her shaggy, the bettter to contend with Michigan Januaries. We like they banked the lot's abundant leaves around her hoouse to preserve added warmth.</p>
<p>Before the sale, Pat and I had traveled with Jim and Linda in their VW Bus, to D. C. to protest the war. There are a few pictures of that trip. </p></div>

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>No – it’s not a Christmas card – I don’t get around to those until about the second week in January. Nothing new, just cold and wet, dismal, dreary. Chewy did manage to become alert enough to have <u>6</u> kittens - that little thing. They are nice and healthy – now we have a total of ten animals around here. What every family needs.</p>
<p>We won’t make it to Texas for Christmas, but might be there around the end of February. Not sure yet. Walt’s sister is still traveling around Europe – Enjoying every minute of it. She sent us a six person plate ((?)) (Looks like a bowling ball mold) from Morocco and something from Greece, which hasn’t arrived yet, and with Bette’s taste, I’m not looking forward to its arrival. She was met at the train station in a Yugoslavia Bordertown., Taken to a luxury hotel to a flower layden room,  then they found out she wasn’t who they expected – an Australian ping-pong player!</p>
<p>How are things at your house? Better I hope. Hope to hear from you soon.
Love
Pat

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>Thank you for the letter and picture – we enjoyed hearing from and seeing you.</p>
<p>Things are pretty dull around here although we have had an enjoyable summer so far – mostly [illegible ]– went camping and hope to go on a canoe trip soon – up around Canada and Minnesota.</p>
<p>Walt is working on a paper which is due toward the end of August. And I’m busy trying to do as little as possible – as usual.</p>
<p>I enjoyed meeting your motorcyclist friend, we had coffee – but Walt was out of town at the time, so I didn’t ask him to stay. I’m sorry Walt missed meeting him. If you get a chance to see the movie – “the Summer of 42“ – we really enjoyed it. I think you would too.</p>
<p>How did the local election turn out in Fort Worth. We had a similar situation, but surprisingly, the local candidate one – even though he had harsh criticism during his previous term and was considered the underdog incumbent that he was. And how do you feel about politics in general after the recent exposé? we saw Daniel Ellsberg on Dick Cavett and enjoyed that. I kind of feel – what the hell does it matter? Who wins on what platform – does it make any difference. Restore my faith! </p>
<p>Almost forgot – Walt ran into Paul Grosser who is here attending a poli-sci seminar. He’s teaching at LSU now – said Jim Peterson went bankrupt. </p>
<p>Walt just talked to him briefly – and hasn’t seen him since, but Paul is planning on spending the summer here – his wife is to join him shortly. We’ve talked about inviting them out – but I don’t know if we will – even want to. it would be sort of a revival of many things pleasantly or finally forgotten. Sorry I write so seldomly – do let us hear from you</p>
<p>Love Pat</p>
<p>PS Marilyn Butler may visit us with her new Jewish beau. </p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
  <p>I wondered why I felt guilty when I talked to you – a sort of vague uneasiness – then I went in the study and saw that robe – still unfinished – I meant to send months ago. Better hang on rags for a while – one of these days I’ll get around to it. Sorry. </p>
<p>I did enjoy talking to you though and wish even more that you could visit. I really miss you and Mike (yes, even him). I don’t know why I added that– but any person who is captured on film <a href="../pic/EveLetter/Mike Fox banana.jpg" target="_blank">smoking a banana</a> deserves some amount of <u>something</u>. Walt has more pictures to print and I’ll send them along soon. If you want more copies of these or larger or smaller sizes, let us know.</p>
<p>We still don’t know about visiting Texas this summer – and you people keep trying to get here. Hope to hear from you soon,</p>
<p>Love, Pat

<div class="grid-item"><p>Pat and Walt went to Fort Worth as often as we coud afford. The 1200 mile distancew from Whitmore Lake to Fort Worth was somehow closer than the 600 from El Paso to Fort Worth had been. </p><p>The times were different in the 70's too. Viet Nam war weariness and the relative impotence of the public to effectively reverse course saw displacement behaviors: wild swings in clothing and music styles along with smoking any and everything.</div>
