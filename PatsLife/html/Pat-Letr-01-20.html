    <p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>We are alive at 802 South Locust, apartment 6M, Champaign, Illinois, 61820. I asked Walt if he had anything special to say – he said, ask for money.</p>
<p>After leaving Fort Worth, we went to Wisconsin, then to Champaign, where we’ll be encamped for seven more weeks. The climate here is terrible - it has already rained in the two weeks. We’ve been here – more than El Paso sees in three years. The rain I don’t mind, it’s just the jungle heat – never thought I’d miss the Sun City barf. </p>
<p>Did you know that Mickey Mouse wears a Spiro Agnew wrist watch? </p>
<p>I hope you are all there well.</p>
<p>We left Blacky and Brownie to spend the summer in Fort Worth, and brought only Chewy with us.</p> 
<p>Walt’s growing a beard - how did you ever adjust to a beard, Eve? Does it ever get softer? </p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon. Our telephone number is 356–372 in case you get an urge to call.</p>
<p>Love. Pat.</p>

<div class="grid-item"><p>Pat read books while Walt took preparatory classes at the University of Illinois, prior to one more go at Michigan. Walt was freshly discharged from the Army; he took an early out from the Army for the purpose of going to graduate school. Cutting his enlistment short by two months may have been more important than graduate school. The Viet Nam war had grown more and more objectionable; that Richard M Nixon had ascended to the top of the Chain of Command was simply intolerable. </p>

<p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>I hope you’re still at this address – it’s been so long since I’ve written, It’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>Haven’t written cause things stay the same around here. Walt goes to school, I go to work; on the weekends, we drink beer and talk about the studies and the work done during the week. Not very exciting. But we are both glad to be in Ann Arbor – and, good God sometimes we even miss El Paso. </p>
<p>How’s Mike’s progress? Are you in school?</p>
<p>I wish you didn’t have the bad habit of writing only when you’re written to. That’s not fair. How are we supposed to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>We have Chewy and Brownie with us (Blackie’s with the Bronstad‘s). Chewy and Browne get along beautifully together since Browns been “fixed.“ Only thing is that his hair is fallen out in big splotches. Where he has hair, it’s long and shiny, but baldness really doesn’t become him.</p>
<p>We are very, very close to buying a small house of a friend who is leaving. It’s really just a winterized lake cottage on Whitmore Lake (exactly 9.4 miles from campus). It has two bedrooms and looks sort of like this [illustration] Makes your house on Signal Peak [El Paso] look big. Has a dark room in the basement. Has a garage and a nice sized (?) (big compared to house) corner lot with lots of trees – on a lake where swimming, fishing, etc. is allowed.</p>
<p>So if the deal goes through, we cut payments from $150 (rent) to $50 (house payments). Sounds great to us – and no neighbors attacking our eardrums 24 hours a day. {of course though we will have a loan payment of $60 a month, but it’s still cheaper}</p>
<p>Please do write and tell us what’s going on – how the kids are, etc.</p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>

 <div class="grid-item"><p>Pat got a job at Parke-Davis, a pharmaceutical company. The two of us were living in an apartment (351 B Longshore Dr) in Ann Arbor. Two students Walt had known in 1963 and 1964, Jim and Linda Lee Taylor lived at 362 Grove, Whitmore Lake, MI. Jim had a post doc in London, so the two wanted to travel light and sell out.</p>

<p>Dear Mike & Eve,</p>
<p>We didn’t have enough animals before, so we acquired two more. A huge dog and an almost as huge cat came with the house we bought. Boo the dog, is not a very good watchdog, but she really attacks the scraps from the table and any crumbs she finds while she’s running around the house ant-eater style. Pi can’t get used to being the cat around here. She only comes around at meal time and she eats very fast, grumbling the whole time.</p>
<p>We’ve been here almost 2 weeks now – have planted even more flowers. The tulips, violets, hyacinth, and daffodils are in bloom, it is really quiet and peaceful here though we hardly been around much. We just got back from Washington. [D. C.]</p>
<p>The mood there this time was very subdued, almost apathetic. I guess no one really had any confidence that the protest would do any good, but just couldn’t think of any other method. We came away more depressed than ever.</p>
<p>The primary in Texas was really a shock – though I guess it shouldn’t have been. It sounds as if Michigan will be just as well represented as you – I have a real fear that Mrs. Romney will win over Senator Hart. Add her to Griffin – and Gerald Ford – now I’m really depressed!</p>
<p>Right to tell us how you’re doing, etc. </p>
<p>Love, Pat</p>

<div class="grid-item"><p>So we bought the house; the dog, Boo, conveyed with it. A shaggy, needy dog that could  have used shearing, but Jim and Linda let Boo confront the cold in her dog house, so wwe like they would leave her shaggy, the bettter to contend with Michigan Januaries. We like they banked the lot's abundant leaves around her hoouse to preserve added warmth.</p>
<p>Before the sale, Pat and I had traveled with Jim and Linda in their VW Bus, to D. C. to protest the war. There are a few pictures of that trip. </p>

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>Thank you for the letter and picture – we enjoyed hearing from and seeing you.</p>
<p>Things are pretty dull around here although we have had an enjoyable summer so far – mostly [illegible ]– went camping and hope to go on a canoe trip soon – up around Canada and Minnesota.</p>
<p>Walt is working on a paper which is due toward the end of August. And I’m busy trying to do as little as possible – as usual.</p>
<p>I enjoyed meeting your motorcyclist friend, we had coffee – but Walt was out of town at the time, so I didn’t ask him to stay. I’m sorry Walt missed meeting him. If you get a chance to see the movie – “the Summer of 42“ – we really enjoyed it. I think you would too.</p>
<p>How did the local election turn out in Fort Worth. We had a similar situation, but surprisingly, the local candidate one – even though he had harsh criticism during his previous term and was considered the underdog incumbent that he was. And how do you feel about politics in general after the recent exposé? we saw Daniel Ellsberg on Dick Cavett and enjoyed that. I kind of feel – what the hell does it matter? Who wins on what platform – does it make any difference. Restore my faith! </p>
<p>Almost forgot – Walt ran into Paul Grosser who is here attending a poli-sci seminar. He’s teaching at LSU now – said Jim Peterson went bankrupt. </p>
<p>Walt just talked to him briefly – and hasn’t seen him since, but Paul is planning on spending the summer here – his wife is to join him shortly. We’ve talked about inviting them out – but I don’t know if we will – even want to. it would be sort of a revival of many things pleasantly or finally forgotten. Sorry I write so seldomly – do let us hear from you</p>
<p>Love Pat</p>
<p>PS Marilyn Butler may visit us with her new Jewish beau. </p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
  <p>I wondered why I felt guilty when I talked to you – a sort of vague uneasiness – then I went in the study and saw that robe – still unfinished – I meant to send months ago. Better hang on rags for a while – one of these days I’ll get around to it. Sorry. </p>
<p>I did enjoy talking to you though and wish even more that you could visit. I really miss you and Mike (yes, even him). I don’t know why I added that– but any person who is captured on film <a href="../pic/EveLetter/Mike Fox banana.jpg" target="_blank">smoking a banana</a> deserves some amount of <u>something</u>. Walt has more pictures to print and I’ll send them along soon. If you want more copies of these or larger or smaller sizes, let us know.</p>
<p>We still don’t know about visiting Texas this summer – and you people keep trying to get here. Hope to hear from you soon,</p>
<p>Love, Pat

<div class="grid-item"><p>Pat and Walt went to Fort Worth as often as we coud afford. The 1200 mile distancew from Whitmore Lake to Fort Worth was somehow closer than the 600 from El Paso to Fort Worth had been. </p><p>The times were different in the 70's too. Viet Nam war weariness and the relative impotence of the public to effectively reverse course saw displacement behaviors: wild swings in clothing and music styles along with smoking any and everything.</p>

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>No – it’s not a Christmas card – I don’t get around to those until about the second week in January. Nothing new, just cold and wet, dismal, dreary. Chewy did manage to become alert enough to have <u>6</u> kittens - that little thing. They are nice and healthy – now we have a total of ten animals around here. What every family needs.</p>
<p>We won’t make it to Texas for Christmas, but might be there around the end of February. Not sure yet. Walt’s sister is still traveling around Europe – Enjoying every minute of it. She sent us a six person plate ((?)) (Looks like a bowling ball mold) from Morocco and something from Greece, which hasn’t arrived yet, and with Bette’s taste, I’m not looking forward to its arrival. She was met at the train station in a Yugoslavia Bordertown., Taken to a luxury hotel to a flower layden room,  then they found out she wasn’t who they expected – an Australian ping-pong player!</p>
<p>How are things at your house? Better I hope. Hope to hear from you soon.
Love
Pat

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
  <p>Thanks for writing – Julie is really growing up since we’ve seen her – and very pretty too. I’ve been intending to write, but never sit down and do it. We do have some news – I’m pregnant. We figured if we were ever going to have kids, we’d have to do it soon, so come September, there will be another Bronstad. We wonder sometimes if we made the right decision; the other times we know we didn’t!</p>
  <p>Not much else is new. Walt still working hard – and getting closer to finishing. He almost excepted a job at the university of Cincinnati, but decided he better stick around here until he finishes. </p>
  <p>And that’s fine with me. I like it here in our little house – and it is cheap – guess I should say in expensive – sounds better.</p>
  <p>Spring is here. Finally our tulips are coming up and the last of the leaves are falling off the trees. it was in the 60s today. I hate to go to the office on days like this.</p>
  <p>I don’t know when we’ll be in Texas again. Guess one of these days you’ll just have to pack your things and come up here. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Eve, thanks so much for sending all those clothes. I can really use them. It was very thoughtful of you. Except for about with some kind of virus, I’ve been feeling just great – getting fat and lazy. The weather has been beautiful – and our yard is very green and restful. Walt planted a garden so I hope in a couple of months we’ll have some really fresh vegetables on our table. </p>
  <p>We are planning a camping trip for the first week in July up in the Porcupine Mountains. We will stay in a cabin – a 3 mile walk in the middle of the woods -for five days and the rest of the time, will camp in the tent. we made several trips last year and enjoyed it tremendously – so we are really looking forward to this.</p>
  <p>Not much else is new. Walt is still studying hard and hope to be finished with a year. I have another month to work then the rest of December off. Unless we were starving – which isn’t too unlikely – I plan to end my working career for quite a while. Everyone is betting I’ll be bored, but I plan to fool them all.</p>
  <p>Thanks again for the clothes. Write soon.</p>
  <p>Love.
Pat</p>
  <p>PS I’ll send them [ clothes] back in October.

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for sending the pretty sweater booties and blanket. Judging by this summer, it will be a cold winter and these warm things will be very nice to have. I was just getting ready to write you last week when I got your card, so you had would have heard from me anyway – even if you didn’t send a gift.</p>
<p>The doctor says the baby won’t arrive until the end of September – I’m tired of waiting! But it’s been very nice taking it easy this summer – we went camping, but besides that have just been lazy. I didn’t know that you had quit work – and what’s this about Mike’s movie script. That really sounds exciting and we’d like to hear more about it.</p>
<p>Walt‘s parents and sister were here a couple of weeks ago and now Bette’s getting ready to go to Africa for a year. My mom will come where – if ever – the baby is born. See why I never write – there is so little that happens around here.</p>
<p>Walt and I just finished an eight week course on natural childbirth – breathing techniques, etc. It was interesting – Walt will be in the labor and delivery rooms – With his camera, I’m afraid! Should be an experience anyway do write and tell us what you’re doing and about the movie. </p>

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>Glad to hear everything is working out – have you moved? We’ve had a quiet summer lazy and pleasant. Walt’s parents were here for a while – then Marilyn Butler stopped by for the weekend. We really enjoyed seeing her – she looks great.</p>
<p>We just got back from a camping trip. Had a very nice time. But when we got back, we found out that our dog had died of pneumonia – she was being treated for heartworm – a parasite that lives in the heart – and I guess the treatment was too much for her. We miss her, but we still have the two cats – Chewy and Brownie are even more independent than ever. </p>
<p>Walt started a new semester today. He hopes to be through here in a year. – Then I hope we can go west – (Washington, Oregon) East or south or north or maybe to New Zealand – but I hope out of the Midwest who knows? Why don’t you come up here on your vacation? We love to see you.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn’t talk to you longer last night; also, that I was so melodramatic. I’m sure I must misrepresent ( badly.) The role of Walt,s therapist. Perhaps if either of you talk to him, he would convince you what a lot of good and what a terrific thing it is. That’s my mind these days – total confusion. Anyway, I would appreciate you not telling Walt what I said – I’m sure he would feel that I had betrayed many confidences.</p>
<p>I was so happy when I read Mike’s letter and your additional note – happy because you really came through as caring about us – about me. And that’s nice – not many people are willing to be so open (and therefore vulnerable) in their feelings – I love you both and I’m getting maudlin —</p>
<p>Philip is growing every day and is a wonderful little boy – right now he is playing in the toilet so I can finish the letter without interruption. I really felt good after talking to you</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat. </p>

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>Hope you had a nice Christmas and New Year’s. Ours was sort of quiet and cold. So cold in fact, Texas is sounding better and better. How much do old houses cost around there? If not too personal, how much was yours, your monthly payments, taxes, etc.? We have been seriously thinking of moving there – so send us lots of info – that is, if you’re interested in seeing us around all the time. Don’t mention this to Bronstad‘s – if they thought we were even thinking about moving there, they’d bug us to death. we can wait until we’re there for that. Know of any property? We’d kind of like a big old house, nice sized yard, trees – a house we can get cheap and fix up ourselves. Tell us you’re happy to hear that. Or would you get tired of us – you’re so used to seeing us once a year, more might be too much! Let me hear from you soon Please answer questions. </p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat.</p>

<p>Dear Mike and Eve,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the candle – it’s really pretty and smells good too. I probably won’t get to the store for a card for you, Eve, so happy birthday – and don’t buy a new robe. While in Texas, I bought some towels to make you a replacement robe, but didn’t get around to making it. One day, soon – I hope, I’ll get it sewn together and send it to you. Yes, we were serious about your visiting us. In fact, we are counting on it. It was really nice seeing you again; I wish I could have spent more time with you.</p>
<p>We mentioned to Bette, <u>Walt‘s</u> sister, about the film Mike made – and she’s really excited. Wants to send you a résumé – the same one she sent to Marvin Van Peebles; said all her fans would recommend her; etc. Etc. We are going to send her your address because I think you would enjoy her.</p>
<p>February 2</p>
<p>The previous is quite old – wrap fish in it or something.</p>
<p>I’ve almost completed the robe – need to get a zipper.</p>
<p>You are probably familiar with <u>The Diary Anaïs Nin</u> but if not, I highly recommend it to you. There are four volumes – I’m only into the first so far and it is really great reading.</p>
<p><u>Philip‘s</u> doing fine – sitting up now and is continuing his healthy growth. The doctor said he was a very healthy <u>10 month old</u>.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the candle – and continue to write frequently. I enjoy hearing from you.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat.</p>
<p>Walt hasn’t given up, hopes that Mike might answer his letter.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry I haven’t written – first. I was waiting for some pictures to send, then Walt’s parents came, and so on and on.</p>
<p>As you can see, Philip is really growing and getting into everything. He’s eight months now, has four teeth and crawls, stands, and is a lot of fun –. When we visited you at Christmas, Mike wondered who would adapt to who’s schedule – Phillip won by lots more than a nose.</p>
<p>Walt‘s in kind of a slump now – not doing too much work (if any) on his dissertation. His present job ends in June and he’s having trouble lining up another one that’s even halfway acceptable to him.</p>
<p>Do you still plan to visit us? I hope so. we are hoping to go camping in Canada sometime this summer – why not join us? Have you been watching the Watergate hearings?</p>
<p>We think of you too a lot – and hope to see you soon.
Love, Pat</p>
<p>We have not gone to a counselor yet – Walt’s still seeing his shrink. Our situation zooms up, goes down, stays in the middle, moves up, etc. I really don’t know what our problems are – many at times – few at times. But we still keep working – and I hope we continue to work together. From conversations with friends, it seems our situation is certainly not unique – but that doesn’t make it better. It’s hard to verbalize thoughts sometimes - to each other – and you in this letter – that’s why this is rather badly written – but it’s nice to be able to feel free to write about to you. Thanks.</p>
<p>Love, Pat.

<p>Day of swearing-in of new V– P and also day Walt baked cookies </p>
<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for the letter and picture of Julie -  she looks more and more like you. Your greenhouse sounds great – I love plants and would love to fill the house with them – doing pretty well with what little light is available. Send pictures.</p>
<p>I’m not opening a daycare center – the regulations are too involved. What I’m doing is just caring for several kids here in the house. The state legislature has just approved new regulations pertaining to childcare centers so maybe around April I can get involved in a center.</p>
<p>Yes, Philip is walking all over – and he just loves his independence. he walks and talks all the time – babbles really. Besides mama and dad, his first word was shit. He really knows when to use it too – just like his old mom. He surely is a good, sweet little boy (I am not prejudiced!) and his appetite never fails him. We really enjoy him. We took him to a party with us the other night and he simply charmed everyone. Heard enough?</p>
<p>Walt is taking courses and working in the evenings as a security guard. The pay is terrible, but he can use almost all the time studying.</p>
<p>I’m sending you a box for Christmas – something for the kids – and I hope – your long promised robe. I’m really having trouble finding a metal zipper that doesn’t open both ends. In the box will also be Mike’s scripts – I really feel bad about keeping them so long. Will he forgive us? Thanks for sending in the recommendation – I think since I don’t know what you said.</p>
<p>We miss you too. It gets so damn cold up here. Fort Worth is even sounding good – especially with fuel shortage. Walt says hello, Phillips says shit. </p>
<p>Write. </p>
<p>Love, Pat

<p>Still not sure about date of trip – maybe next week. Hope you will use bumper sticker – or are you no longer caring. Did you see the mold in cartoon – an elephant sitting outside the office of an exorcist I loved it! </p>
<p>Will be seeing you soon.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I just have a minute before Walt leaves for the post office, but I wanted to say I haven’t forgotten you, I’m glad about your house. We are fine, Philip‘s growing sweeter every day and I’ll write you very soon. </p>
<p>Love, Pat.</p>
<p>You don’t have to wait for longer letter to write back.

<p>Dear Eve, </p>
<p>I really had a great time at your house. Wish I were back. Remember that evening after the rat turds – when everything was literally rosy and crazy. It never really did change – and that’s what I remember – being in your house, feeling calm, relaxed, and really happy. i’m really lucky to have friends like you and Mike – just too bad you were so far away. Walt still feels like he should stay here and I guess I’m not ready to abandon him – although if I keep being as bitchy as I have been lately, I may be the one who gets left.</p>
<p>After all that spring in Texas, we were greeted almost on the Michigan border, with an ice storm – got stuck on the freeway for a while, etc. etc. It’s been like that since we’ve been back. One day it was nice to stay outside for over an hour without freezing. We stopped at Mammoth Cave in Kentucky on the way back - not as pretty as Carlsbad and I got a rock for Julie - I’ll mail it soon. Also, let me know which Sunset books you guys want cause we have quite a few on gardening that we could send you. Bought this paper cause it reminded me of the needlepoint you were doing – did you finish it? Do write –</p>
<p> love Pat.
