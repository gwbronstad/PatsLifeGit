<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>It seems funny that you’re getting spring fever and we are beginning Autumn ( not fall here). It seems even funnier that here I am back in school. It’s been three weeks now and I’m really enjoying my classes – just wish I were smarter.  I just me [sic] one class this term, but I have two lectures and one tutorial. The tutorial is a small class – just 12 of us – and I’m old enough to be not only the mother of all the students, but the lecturer as well.) The lectures, Legal Systems are quite large – probably 75–100 students, yet we have a seating chart and we are all called on for answers. I’m enjoying this course more than any I’ve ever had – but it’s lots of work ( Our first assignment is due Monday – we are given a legal problem to solve taking all three sides – the defense, prosecution and judicial ) and 75% of the students taking this course fail. I will try not to be in that group, but sometimes I just <u>know</u> I will be. Oh for some confidence!</p>
<p>Matthew’s school is having a fair on Saturday and strangely enough, it’s Walt who has to work in a booth. Matthew will bake a cake for the bake sale. Kate &amp; Kris will bake cookies. I’m really enjoying the kids (more or maybe not) now that they are getting older and really participating - like doing the dishes and the cooking!  I do remind them to write, but I guess as they get more involved here, the less time they spend writing to the states. Good &amp; bad sides to that, isn’t there ?</p>
<p>How are the wedding plans going? Are you going to pull down the old garage completely? What will you use for storage then? Sorry to make this short, but I have to leave now, but I wanted you to know that I’m thinking about you - and enjoy getting your letters.</p>
<p> We do get  Time Magazine here (for me and Matt  - Walt hates Time, but the Newsweek is included in the business magazine from Australia and is too expensive). And so did see an article that ole Garrison was moving to Sweden (or Denmark). Also, we keep up with the downfall of the Reagans (which we love)</p>
<p>Write soon</p>
<p>Love Pat

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>How was the wedding? Did it rain? Will the newlyweds continue to live on Tierney? We got Amy’s announcement - and her lovely picture. We are in the middle of May break – the kids (and I) are off from school for two weeks. It’s nice here they have two weeks off often – and the most at one time is six weeks – at Xtmas. However, I think that will change soon since people feel that six weeks is just too long. Actually, two weeks is great because they don’t have time to get <u>real</u> bored. Kate &amp; Kris and Matthew have been to several movies, had friends over, been over to friends, had lunch with Walt, etc. And <u>I’m</u> ready for them to go back next week. I’m supposed to be studying for a test this next Tuesday – and it’s hard with everyone around all the time.</p>
<p>Walt and I are going to a Cambodian festival Saturday – there are lots of Asians in New Zealand – matter of fact, there are lots of people from everywhere – especially Asian &amp; Great Britain &amp; Europe. Not a lot from US but quite a few from Canada, I’m surprised that New Zealand is so multi - cultural, maybe it’s just Wellington – because it’s the capital – there are areas of Greeks, Indians, Dutch Landers, Finnish, etc., and just about every area of New Zealand. And since Chernobyl there has been an increased interest in immigration from Sweden.</p>
<p>I read in time magazine about the fall of Gary Hart. Did anyone in your house? Feel sad? </p>
<p>Walt built a loft in Kate‘s room. The closet had a flat area above it since the ceiling is one of those A-frame styles. So he enlarged it, put in a railing and quicker than he got it built, Kris moved out of her room and into Kate’s. They really like it – (and Matthew wants one now.) They keep all their stuffed animals up there, sleep there – and curl up with a book up there. The only other exciting thing is that we bought and planted a lovely Japanese maple. There are few deciduous trees here in New Zealand I felt we needed something to remind us that it really is autumn in May. Hope it does well. How are the New Zealand plants doing? Do you need more?</p>
<p>Love, Pat.

<p>No longer sure why i thought the sleeping loft useful. Perhaps the girls bed rooms had too little space for their activities. The viewing angle of the Karori valley from the loft was superb.</p>
<p>For the mattress, I bought a futon; heavy, stuffed with cotton. I expected Kate to turn the mattress at least weekly. Was disappointed to find she had never turned it. When I tried to turn the futon in the cramped, confined space of the loft, it was nearly imossible for me. Poor planning on my part.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Am glad Amy liked the earrings? Did you? Would you like a pair? I think they are quite pretty, but since I don’t wear earrings, don’t know if they are too large and clunky, or what. They do look lovely on the lady who sells them. </p>
<p>I am in the middle of a two week study break. The classes which go for just 1/2 the year are having finals now. My classes are full year ones so no finals for me at this stage. I am starting another class though next week. I’m looking forward to it – and wished I had taken more at the first of the year. I will take a full load next year – if I pass. There are 500 of us trying for 200 places in the second year. And the competition is heating up. I’m holding my own - wish I were doing better <u>but</u>. I’ve done well on all my assignments, but the first test I failed! Did quite well on the next test though. But the thing that really scares me is that the final exam is 100% of the grade. I have to make 100 points through the year on assignments and tests out of 200 to be able to set the final exam. So far I’m OK – but just the fact that it all <u>rides</u> on one test is so frightening.</p>
<p>The kids liked seeing that Garfield comic strip and Matthew wondered if you could send the whole comic page sometime.</p>
<p>It has been cold and wintery here – but today the sun is out.</p>
<p>We’ve all been doing OK – Walt has been working quite a bit of overtime lately. We will all be glad when the special project is out of the way.</p>
<p>Matthew finally joined the orchestra at his school. Kate &amp; Kris continue to take her music lessons on Saturday mornings. We are going to a Fourth of July party at our American friends house. She’s making hamburgers and I’m bringing the apple pie. Have we had our fill of apples lately. Walt bought a 36 pound bag (no I guess 40 pound bags -18 kilos each) of granny Smith apples for $14 (and they threw in 5 kg of kiwi fruit – which I have acquired an insatiable taste for). So we’ve had apple pies, apple cakes, apple, jam, apples, etc. Etc. Etc. We’ve gotten through one bag and have started on the second. I have to go now - started driving for meals on wheels on Fridays – and must leave now –</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat </p>
<p>PS sorry didn’t realize it was so late - hello to all.

<p>We tried to save on groceries by shopping the producers' markets. New Zealand is an exporter of food, so export commodities were often over produced. Thus 10 or even 20 kilos of frozen flounder or orange roughy could be a good buy. Ditto Apples, Kiwi fruit and lamb.</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Have you got the earrings and like them. The little shop where I buy them – and other neat crafty things – is moving from Karori Mall to the other side of town. I’ll miss it. A few weeks ago I bought a beautiful Indian silk scarf (really a shawl) with long red fringe. Maybe it’s good the shop moved
– now I can afford food for the table.</p>
<p>We are all doing fine. We are on break – and usually it’s cold and rainy at this time – but it’s like summer. In fact, this whole winter has been a lot like summer. We had one light frost – and no southerly gale force winds. Anyway, all four of us are out of school for two weeks. Unfortunately, my two weeks don’t coincide with theirs – had one week without them – and they will have one without me. It works out OK except that they on Tuesdays and Thursdays when I’m gone all day. My neighbor Evelyn has offered to have them all over for lunch on those days. She has no kids and loves cooking lunch for them. Evelyn, from the Philippines, (is married to an American, who is over here for one year) was a TV star in the Philippines, but left when Marcos took over the TV channel. She wrote comedy shows, act in them, hosted game shows, talkshows, etc. She’s only 31 now so she must’ve been a child prodigy but she is cute and fun to be with.</p>
<p>Is Amy already for college? What is Julie up to these days? Where is she staying in Austin or what? Have you been there lately?</p>
<p>Our plans for our visit are coming along. We leave here on 12 December – Spend two days in Disneyland, arrive in FW on the 16th. We’ll stay there until the 12th, then go to Austin for a week (the kids would never forgive us if they couldn’t see their old friends), go back to Fort Worth the second. On 3 January, we will fly up to Wisconsin, fly back to New Zealand on the ninth. We are looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Walt and I went to see “Crimes of the Heart“ last night. I really enjoyed it – did you see it? We don’t go to very many movies – and the ones I usually insist on seeing are what Walt calls my women movies – The Color Purple, Heartburn, Out of Africa. I told him he doesn’t have to come, but he does – and he did enjoy Crimes of the Heart much more than any of the others.</p>
<p>We are having a few friends over for dinner – a guy who is in my law classes and a woman plus her husband. I will feed them red beans and tacos. Hope they like them. Walt and I ate at the Mexican Cantina a couple of weeks ago – and it was surprisingly good – but expensive! However, they make their own tortillas which they sell in packages – those those with the Pace’s picante sauce my sister brought over should make the tacos tasty.</p>
<p>Sunday we went out to see the seals at Red Rock. We had gone out before, but it was so windy, we had to turn around that time. The wind was so strong Kate and Kris couldn’t walk – in fact several times they came close to being literally blown away. What a strange experience that was. This time, however there was or no wind and we had a lovely hours walk to see those animals sunning themselves. The smell was awful!</p>
<p>It was so nice to be out of school for a while – no studying. But I’m beginning to miss it. If I pass this year, I plan to take a full load next year. If I fail, I don’t know what I’ll do! Oh well I don’t have to face that yet. I took my terms test last week and I think I at least passed. Must go – got to take the kids out for a while.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat

<p>Dear Eve </p>
<p>Here it is birthday time again I just finished baking Walt a chocolate marble poundcake with chocolate glaze. I can’t wait to taste it. It looks wonderful. Matthew wants a cherry pie instead of a cake. I just have to find the cherries. He also wants chicken fried steak for his birthday dinner and a shirt, tie and slacks for his present -what happened to that little boy who wanted Star Wars figures and laser guns! They both get the cards you sent - thank you. 
Where in New Zealand are those people you met from and why did they move to US? Just curious</p>
<p>I have received my official admission from to Law School. It begins next March and goes through October. That’s the university academic year. I wish I could start now - I’m ready. </p>
<p>Peg and I went to visit the gardens of the American & Swiss ambassador’s house on Sunday. We also visited Vogel house Gardens (that’s the home of the NZ Prime Minister). They (the Gardens) were beautiful -  the huge tulip trees like we saw in Michigan were in their glory as well as azalea rhododendron‘s, - and lots of other spring flowers. We stopped for tea and scones at the Anglican church - all in all it was a very pleasant outing</p>
<p>We haven’t done much else, but since it seems spring has arrived - and the days are warm and sunny, we hope to see more of the countryside.  During the winter. We found a small ice cream place at a beach - (Days Bay) - Do you ever read Katherine Mansfield? She’s a New Zealand writer - lived here in Karori for a while , and some of her descriptions of Wellington are still very good (accurate) after 50 years). Anyway we hope to get back to the blue penguin ice cream parlor and take a walk and that beautiful beach</p>
<p>(The ice cream here in New Zealand is not very good compared to Bluebell and Swenson’s - but the blue Penguin’s compares quite well. - I love to get the coffee ice cream dipped in chocolate. (I noticed that I’ve written a lot about food. - I think it’s because for three weeks I have not eaten any between meal snacks - doing OK but sure do think  about eats a lot.)</p>
<p> My knee is OK so I’ve been running again. It seems that I stretched a ligament because my shoes were worn out. But with my new shoes I just sail along well not quite sail but at least I can run without pain. </p>
<p>We are going to have a party - since we’ve been here a year - and have invited about 20 people. I hope it will be fun at least not a disaster. A lot of people we’ve met through Data Bank are from other countries - so we will have people here from the US (Peg and Hugh Gilman), New Zealand, England, Canada, Argentina, Finland, and Portugal. Sounds so international doesn’t it. And Switzerland Forgot about the Bopps, These people for the most part don’t know each other - just us -  I’m not cooking (here. I go with food again) but will have ham, corn beef lots of bread and veggies for sandwiches. Wish you could come!</p>
<p>Mary and Jimmy are still planning on coming at Christmas. (Do I tell you things over and over? I’m sorry if I do) </p>
<p>I’ve got to stop now must go to veggie market and post office and pick up Kris & Kate. </p>
<p>Love </p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>PS Kate and Kris liked cat story -

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Thanks for remembering birthdays – and I’m sorry that I forgot. But tell Amy and Julie happy birthday from us. Some year I’ll surprise you and remember everyone’s. Birthdays this year were really low-key in this house. Matthew didn’t want to “do“ anything – just to have his palm crossed with silver. He quit his paper round after a year – to take karate two days a week – and misses the money. Walt just wanted a subscription to the Economist. Kate and Kris unfortunately had their birthdays the day before my big important final. Walt cooked lasagna for them and made the cake while I studied, and I studied all day and the whole week before. The exam counts 100% of the course class grade – three hours long – and so much to do that there was little time to think. I came out not knowing if I passed or not, and won’t know until around the first of December. Most of the people sitting the exam also felt the same insecure way I do – we’ve been ringing each other with consolations and self derogatories hoping we scraped past – to go on to do another year. Don’t know if it’s worth it or not. I have one more final next week – also three hours long – and I’m not looking forward to it, but it can’t be as bad as yesterday. How are the things going at UTA. Does Amy like her courses?</p>
<p>I went out to lunch today with a friend. I met when we first moved here. She had just moved here from England – next week she is moving to Auckland, where her husband will be the manager of a yuppie style hotel in the middle of a vineyard – supposedly in the style of informal yet elegant French hotels – where one spends hours eating and drinking. Heinz is a Swiss trained hotel manager, and was sought after for this position. He, Sandy and the two boys will live in a rose covered (literally) cottage in the Vineyard. Sounds idyllic doesn’t it. Anyway, so Sandy and I had lunch at the Mexican Cantina – not the Mexican Inn, but still a tasty place. We had tacos that were quite good except I don’t think they had been near jalapeño. But it was better than the taco I had once that was filled with cottage cheese and pineapple (Polynesian style = pineapple)</p>
<p>Walt’s Mother, sister, and niece were due to arrive here next Tuesday, but Louise had a heart attack about three weeks ago – so I guess instead of being in Germany at Christmas they will still be in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>Matthew got stung by a bee on Saturday and he turned into Bigfoot and has been out of school for two days cause he can’t get his shoe on. The swelling is going down now.</p>
<p>Kate is sitting across from me doing a report on Mexico and it’s getting hard to concentrate on this letter – she is either asking me questions or telling me something, she’s discovered about the country. Kris is up in her room with the binoculars spying on the neighbors. I hope she tells me if she sees something interesting.</p>
<p>I can’t wait till next week – I’m going to read a book that has no redeeming value at all – don’t know what it will be but I’m looking forward to it. But also, we I have to clean this house– it even looks dirty without my glasses.</p>
<p>Can’t think of anything interesting this happened around here lately. Thought Amy might enjoy the article – they still can’t get Humphrey [Elephant seal attracted to cows] (his new name) to leave the farm. They filled him full of tranquilizers, but no effect because of the blubber. They tried to chase (guide) him back to sea, but he wouldn’t have it – so a week later – Humphrey’s still around – flirting with the cows.</p>
<p>Love</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Spring is here finally – well actually it’s been around a while in the form of rain – rain and more rain. This past weekend was sunny after at least four that webre not. Kate & Kris had their birthday on a rainy Saturday; 14 little girls came and giggled, squealed, and had a good time at the first (and last)  birthday party in New Zealand. (It rained on their birthday last year too, but they didn’t have a party.) Parties here are a little different. Everyone comes for a meal – of pizza, hotdogs, sausage, rolls, etc. – anything that can be construed as junk food and then the birthday girl’s (in this case girls’) parents pile everyone in their car to take them home. After three hours, that was the best time for me and Walt. The party was enlivened by a gift of a Whoopie cushion which sent these giggly girls into even greater gales. We thought we had bought tons of food – but it disappeared in minutes ( the only thing green on the table was grapes – so nobody could say, yuck). Fortunately after two games which involved wholesale eating of chocolate, everyone did get their fill. Kate & Kris said they had a wonderful time – and understand that we can’t do that every year – I hope.</p>
<p>Matthew has a paper route (paper round it’s called here). The little girl who delivered our paper left for France. (her mother will study cello in Paris) for five months and wanted someone to take her place while she’s gone. So Matthew has his first job. he delivers 42 papers on our street, and the two below. It only takes him about 30 minutes – and it’s just six days a week – and he will earn $22.50 a fortnight (every two weeks). He’s quite pleased – even though it has rained on him just about every day so far – and is busy, figuring out ways to spend his salary. 
Thanks for that lovely picture of Amy. Can’t believe she’s a senior this year. What are her plans for college?</p>
<p>Kate and Kris will have their pictures taken at school tomorrow – I don’t know how long it takes to get them – maybe with Christmas cards you’ll get them. Walt had a roll of film developed, but the results were not too good. We take more soon.</p>
<p>Can’t think of much else going on. I will be going to Law School beginning in March. I know it will take a long time, but I’m going to try anyway. I don’t just want to go out and type for someone; I want someone to type for me!  Did I tell you that Victoria University is quite close to us – closer than UT was to us in Austin. I could just hop on the bus or drive, but parking is a problem) and be there in a few minutes. I’m really looking forward to going – and wish I didn’t have to wait until March (the academic year is March – November) 
Walt built a beautiful wall unit for the TV, stereo, etc. It’s made out of native remu (or rimu ) and it really makes the room look neat.  Also he’s in the process of making bookshelves for my study, which is also the computer room, music, practice room, etc.). </p>
<p>Must close, the bread is ready to come out of the oven – and I have to work in school library this afternoon.</p>
<p>All hello to all</p>
<p>Love Pat

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Did there used to be so little time between Thanksgiving and Christmas? Time seems to go faster and faster, doesn’t it? And the old skin sags more and more (at least mine does).</p>
<p>We did celebrate Thanksgiving this year – with the Gilman‘s. They immigrated here from Boston. Hugh works at databank, they have three boys 15, 13 and 10. Peg‘s mother just moved over here too – so we all had Thanksgiving with all the trimmings – even pecan pie. (I did pay a fortune for those nuts.) Margaret, Peg mom bought and cooked the turkey, Peg did all the veggies and the pumpkin pie. I did homemade rolls fruit salad and the pie. It really was just like Thanksgiving – we had a good time.</p>
<p>That was two Sundays ago. This Sunday we go to the annual Christmas picnic where Father Christmas makes an appearance. we are all looking forward to Mary and Jimmy‘s visit. They will spend a week at the condo at Lake Taupo – about 200 km (200 miles) from here. There will be enough room for us to join them for that week (Christmas) and then we’ll all come back here For another week. We hope to take the boat across to the South Island and spend some time in the Marlboro sounds – that depends on the weather.</p>
<p>Today is the last day of school for Matthew. I think he’s had a good year – and enjoyed his classmates – for the most part. he still gets teased a bit about being an American, but if he weren’t, I’m sure he would get teased about being short, having freckles or just breathing. Boys are 13–14 (I don’t know about other ages) are really hard on each other. He has done well at school, but could’ve done better – he says now. (he will forget that until the end of next year).</p>
<p>Kate and Kris have another week to go. They even sound like the kids at school now. They’ve made a lot of friends – and still talk all the time. Kate and Kris and Matt saveed their money and bought two zebra finches - named Austin and Carrot. Maybe with vacation they pop will take some time to write Amy - they miss hearing from her.</p>
<p>My knee is all better so I have I have been running every morning – I walk the girls to school (18 minutes) run back home through two parks and several side streets (30 minutes), climb back up The hill (72 steps) and walk to the house (10 minutes). So I get an hour of exercise about five days a week. My friend Pat has been finishing up her masters degree and will start running again next week. I look forward to that, it’s hard to make myself go by myself.</p>
<p>We do have some pictures to send, but there was a special on five by sevens, so now I need to get some large envelopes. Of course, there’s not one picture that’s good of all of us – I may send you several.</p>
<p>We hope you have a new nice Christmas – and do write.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Don’t faint! Sorry I haven’t written in a while. Things here have been turbulent since our return from the states. I couldn’t get the classes I wanted to take; took some I didn’t want to take because everything was full! Dropped those - I am just too old to stay up late trying to figure out propositional calculus – somehow my philosophy class was more logic than I was prepared for. Anyway I dropped that and am not in school now. I miss it in a way, but it’s nice not to have all that pressure.</p>
<p>The big news is – – we are all ready to move back to the states – and have our house on the market at this time (in fact, someone is looking at this moment).</p>
<p>We haven’t decided where we will go – only that it probably won’t be Texas. (We had to make some concessions to Walt who is not ready as we are – but ready all the same). I don’t know how long it will take to sell the house (it’s been on the market for two weeks) but we have to sell it before we can go back. There are a lot of houses on the market at the present time - and ours is on the “wrong” end of Karori – which is how we could afford it in the first place. We hope to be out of here around the time school finishes here (mid – December) but who knows.</p>
<p>Otherwise we are all OK. When you recover, write and let me know how you guys are.</p>
<p>Love.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We had a wonderful trip down to the south island. It is really a spectacular place, and I’m glad we got to see it even if it did cost a fortune. We got to the point where we didn’t even bother to look at the snow covered mountains or the beautiful sea views. Because there were just so much to see. The weather was good too – even though there were bad storms in Wellington while we were gone. We stayed for five days on a sheep farm (cheaper than motels) and the last day we got a grand tour of the place. it was lamming season so there were lots of babies around mini twins and triplets so Kate &amp; Kris felt at home (they old and old so much at the lambs that we finally told them to stuff it). We also went to a neighboring farm where sheep were being shared. We were surprised that the sheep were so docile. Sounds boring, but I thought it was really interesting to see what goes on down on the farm. Those farmers, wife included, really work hard. I thought you just bought the things and then a year later you sheared them, but it seems that there’s always something these animals require anyway it was educational – and free.</p>
<p>We also took boat trips (into Milford sound), the kids skied, ice skated – and we all canoed on Avon river in Christchurch. We went to a little town that was a gold mining town years ago – and panned for gold. Had as much luck as, when we dug for diamonds in Arkansas. I will send some seeds soon – sometimes it’s hard to find them. I’m glad you enjoy your job. Too bad you can’t get paid for it. Maybe soon they’ll have an opening.</p>
<p>Our house is still for sale. No buyers yet, but maybe since spring is here, more people will start looking. I hope so. I get depressed thinking that we’re stuck here for good.</p>
<p>Matthew has been going to Karate for about a year now and he seems to like it and do well at it. He has gone to several karate camps on the weekends. </p>
<p>Tell Amy and Julie happy birthday. How is Amy doing at UTA? Will she finished there or go to Austin? What is her major? What is Julie doing? Did she get a masters? Let us know all this stuff. We are all doing just fine</p>
<p>Love</p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>I’m sorry that we can’t come to the party for Mike and Julie – and we were trying to think of something to send – something small enough to send my air. The only thing Walt could think of was jewelry but I told him that Mike didn’t like the last earrings we had sent to him.  So we decided to send the money for the cake. That way all of you could share it. Have something funny put on it like – “oh sheep, another birthday” <New Zealand humor, where sheep outnumbered people 2 to 1>  Make it a really fancy cake – and enjoy. 
Let us know how it all turns out.</p>
<p>Stores are all out of seeds right now – but I’ll keep checking.</p>
<p>House still on market – no buyers yet – but the market will pick up as spring warms up. Right now we are being buffeted by strong Equinox-ical winds just about every day.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat </p>

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Before I forget – don’t send anything to New Zealand. We hope to be back in the states within the next few months. And besides Walt will be in Fort Worth around the 20th or 21st of December. He will be looking for a job on the west coast but will come there to see his parents. I’m sure he will call to see you at least for a short time. Don’t know when we are coming, but we do have someone very interested in this house – whether they are interested as we want them to be is another story.</p>
<p>Kris and Kate went off to a week long camp on 7 November. After an hour there, Kris accidentally put her hand through a glass door. That necessitated an ambulance trip back to Wellington (about 60 miles). Two hours in surgery, and the plaster cast for her arm. Seems she cut an artery, tendon, and a nerve. The artery was completely severed, but was an unimportant one and was tied off. Fortunately the nerve and tendon were not completely severed so alignment was not a problem. Seems she’s very lucky – the Surgeon can’t see that she has lost any feeling or movement in her hand or fingers. The plaster comes off in three more weeks meanwhile, Kate spent the rest of the week at camp and Kris was in the hospital for three days. Kate was jealous that Kris got flowers, magazines, etc. but Kris didn’t complain too much about missing camp</p>
<p>Glad the birthday party went well – it sounded like fun.</p>
<p>We are going to have two Thanksgiving dinners this year. One I’ll cook for some Argentinian friends who have heard about these dinners but never had one. The other one we will have with the Gilman’s - fellow Americans, whose time it is to buy the turkey – quite an undertaking over here (I’m getting a big chicken only about $15 rather than $60 for the turkey). My sister sent pecans for the events.</p>
<p>Kate’s picture is enclosed, but Kris missed school the day the pictures were taken – so look at Kate‘s twice (Kate does have on Kris‘s sweater).</p>
<p>Matthew is busy studying for his finals which begin this week. He’s had this week and last week off from school to study. I just read Tom Robbins jitterbug perfume – it was funny. Right now I’m reading life and death in Shanghai – a true story written by Mien Cheng about the cultural revolution in China.</p>
<p>Hello to everyone</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Pat PS if there’s anything you want from New Zealand you’d better let me know soon.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We have less than three weeks to go before we head back for the states. We are all getting excited – Kate and Kris talk of little else. Matthew is also excited, but he is sitting exams at his school this week and has been busy studying. These are fourth form exams and every fourth former in New Zealand sits the same test at the same time. Matthew has English, science, French, maths, history and music.</p>
<p> I haven’t heard the results of my two exams yet - probably won’t for another week or so.</p>
<p>Walt and Matthew went on a white water raft trip a week or so ago – they had a good time. K and K and I didn’t go because the age limit is 14 years old – and I’m not 14. </p>
<p>I read those Margaret Truman mysteries a while back – they are good – yesterday I saw a book by Elliot, Roosevelt – detective genre with Mrs. Roosevelt as the lead. Have you heard about those? There are at least two of them – and according to book jacket had good reviews. I’ve been reading lots of fiction the last couple of weeks, but nothing noteworthy. Did read Michener’s Texas a couple of months back.</p>
<p>Today we are up in the clouds. We’ve had really beautiful weather lately, but today I look out the window and see a wall of thick white cloud. This doesn’t happen in Wellington too often – and it’s Eerie. </p>
<p>Walt’s  Mother is doing better but still is very weak. She says she has trouble walking. My mother is much the same. How are your parents and Mike’s dad getting along? </p>
<p>In the front of our house we have a small enclosed courtyard, which looks lovely right now - all the roses are in bloom – we’ve had fresh roses in the house for several weeks now. The trees Walt planted are growing – some better than others. We finally did find a pecan tree (pronounced pikin by the garden centre manager) but unfortunately, can’t find any pickins in the store – so we won’t have pecan pie for Thanksgiving. we will have 14 people here on Sunday after Thanksgiving for the traditional dinner - all Americans - did you cook? Did Julie come? We will have pumpkin pie – and of course the turkey – which will cost over $50. And it’s our time to buy the bird this year! </p>
<p>Must go now - enjoy the article.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>You sure got that letter here fast. It’s nice to know that you’ll get this the same week. I write it. We are enjoying getting to know Portland. I didn’t realize it was so big. Or so hilly. We spent Saturday driving around looking at the views. Then went to the science museum for a few hours. Then ended up at Powell‘s bookstore, which takes up a whole city block. I love that store. I was there two hours and only to the C’s in the literature section. I think they must have every new book ever printed – not quite, but the selection was tremendous.</p>
<p>Matthew is enrolled in 10th grade at Woodrow Wilson, High School and Kate and Kris are at Robert Gray Middle School. They, K and K, were pleased to find out that they change classes and have lockers just like high school. Walt researched the area pretty well before we came so we know where and what schools we wanted for the kids. We tried very hard to find a house for rent in the area, but there was nothing. So we took the plunge rather quickly and bought a house. It’s in such a nice well- maintained area just three blocks from Matthew’s school and about seven from K & K’s. It’s on the bus line and the hike and bike trail is very close. Walt can bike to work on the trail and not get on a street until he’s practically at the office. The only problem is that we can’t move in until March 15 or so. We put in an offer and it was accepted, but we have to wait for a house inspection (tomorrow) and then the people will start getting ready to leave. They have been there since the house was built (1960) so it will take them a while. Settlement date is March 15. We’ll be glad. We are living in one room (five of us) (six counting cat) with two double beds, rollaway bed, a table, two chairs, a fridge, stove, sink, TV, chest, 10 pairs of shoes, 11 suitcases, etc., etc. So we find a lot of things to do on the weekends so we can get out. We found Kris in the other room – the bathtub that’s OK until someone needs to use the facilities.</p>
<p>We are all glad to be here – it feels good to be back – even if it’s not all the way back.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Pat

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We get to move into our new house on Saturday – and we can’t wait! This room gets smaller each day. Five people and a cat need more room. The people we bought the house from are really nice. (makes me glad we were nice to the people who bought our house in Wellington ) they are retiring and moving to a smaller house next to a golf course. We bought some of their furniture (ours won’t be here till June) and the pool table for the kids (late Christmas present).</p>
<p>Our new address will be</p>
<p>6907 S. W. 13th Ave.,</p>
<p>Portland, OR  97219.</p>
<p>We won’t have a phone till Saturday – so we’ll give you the number next time.</p>
<p>We’ve done a few things here in spite of the weather – drove to the beach coast (about an hour from here through the coastal mountain range.) also went to the science center – that was fun – a lot of hands-on stuff the kids liked. Saturday night we went out to dinner with Walt’s [second] cousin [Stan Dannis] and his wife [Tanya].</p>
<p>Last week we had a snowstorm that left the city looking like a Christmas card – it was beautiful – but, it didn’t last long.</p>
<p>The kids seem to have fit in at school quicker than they thought. Matthew said it was a lot easier to make friends than he had first feared. He’s invited to a party Friday night and is looking forward to it. But we are all looking forward to Saturday!!!</p>
<p>Now I have to stop and start making phone calls so we can have electricity, phone and garbage bills again.</p>
<p>Tell everyone hello – sorry K & K & M are such poor letter writers – maybe when we get into the house –</p>

<p>Pat</p>
<p>Thanks for the anniversary card

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>We’ve been in our new house a little over two weeks now and find it very comfortable. That’s in spite of the fact that our furniture won’t arrive from New Zealand until June. We bought the kids mattresses which are on the floor in their rooms. We bought a hide-a-bed from the previous owners , and Walt and I dragged the mattress up to our bedroom. Our clothes are either hanging in the closet or folded on the shelf of the closet. We bought den furniture from the Evans also and the kitchen table and chairs. Aside from that, the fridge, washer, dryer, and TV; The house is empty. I think I could get used to this minimalist existence. If only we had a few drawers. We’ve gone to several garage sales to buy silverware and pots and pans. (found a really nice seven piece set of porcelain covered ones – you know the ones painted white with little flowers) for $12. Also, we’ve gotten some nice big hanging pots of plants for a couple of dollars each. I found you a little blue jar – some sort of apothecary one about 4 inches tall with a lid (the same color) that acts as a cup for the medicine(I presume). I’ll bring it when we come – if we come this summer. The kids and I are planning to come, but we don’t know when or how at this point.</p>
<p>Matthew got his learners permit two weeks ago, starts drivers education next week. I don’t know if I’m ready for this stage.</p>
<p>We like the area where we live – It’s really convenient. Our Dictionary has not come yet so I can’t check on my spelling). I started running last week – just around the neighborhood and it’s really a nice neat area. Matthew walks to school (it’s closer to his high school than Zilker was to our old house in Austin) and sometimes comes home for lunch. The shopping area is just a few minutes away and the doctor and dentist are within a five minute walk. K & K’s school is a little further – maybe 10 to 15 minutes by foot – but there’s a busy street between our house and the school. The school bus, however, stops on the next corner.</p>
<p>It is really pretty up here. Have you been to Portland? We took a drive through the Columbia River Gorge on Easter. The waterfalls, snow covered mountains and river valleys are as spectacular as New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our house is 30 years old, but very well-maintained. And the best part – or my favorite part of the house is the built-in desk in the kitchen where I’m sitting now. Of course Matthew loves having a bedroom and bath down in the basement. He comes up to eat when he’s hungry – which is quite often. Will enclose real estate picture of house.</p>
<p>Say hello to all. How are the New Zealand plants coming along? Walt’s mother is coming to visit on April 20 for a few weeks. Kate and Kris go to the sixth grade camping trip on the ninth – will be gone for a week. Kris is a little apprehensive since she only lasted a few hours at camp in New Zealand before she put her hands through that door.  Write. </p>
<p>Love Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>It has been really beautiful here the past month everywhere rhododendrons and azaleas have been in bloom. Even our yard has been very colorful, reds, oranges, yellow, whites; the cherry trees were the first to bloom. Walt’s mom was here for a couple of weeks. We took her to see Mount Hood, the Pacific Ocean and the Columbia River Gorge. We also ate fresh Chinnook salmon which was out of this world. Fish is so fresh and inexpensive here so we eat a lot of it. The kids think we eat too much of it. Our furniture came while Louise was here. It was nice to see our old junk again. And the wall unit Walt made out of New Zealand wood looked great here too.</p>
<p>I have been trying to finish the needle pointing of two chair covers (just the seats) before our friends visit from New Zealand in June. Pat and Brian [Tyler] are on their way to West Germany for a conference and are going to spend a few days with us.</p>
<p>Let’s see – what else. We planted two trees in the front yard; a blue spruce and a sweet gum. Will put out a few more – are looking for a horse chestnut or an oak or a pecan.</p>
<p>The kids are doing fine – Matthew started behind the wheel training on Monday, Kate and Kris have a science project due tomorrow. Each I s working with another friend on the projects. I’ve been running with a girl from New Zealand. We planned to run in the Cascades run on June 18 – it’s 15 K. The furthest I’ve ever run is 10k– so I hope we can do it. On Jackie‘s birthday, she and I ran downtown (53 minutes, 53 seconds) to a restaurant where Walt, the kids and his mom met us for breakfast. That was fun. Then last Saturday, we ran for an hour. We figure we have to run 80–90 minutes for the 15 K! Then I’ll sleep for a week. The kids don’t get out of school until June 14. We (kids and I) are flying into Austin (cheaper than flying to Dallas) on July 11. I haven’t figured out when we go to Fort Worth yet. How are your kids.? You? Mike?</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Pat.

<p>Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Well, here, I am at my job. See my type. See me file – – – well I don’t actually have to file and I really don’t have to type very much. Mostly I just sit here while the boss is out – – – – answer the phones, direct people to the right agency, open the mail. None of this is very challenging and it does not pay very well either, but the hours are right and it is just down the road from the house (5 minute drive). I work Monday through Friday from 9 to 1 – – – I’m here by myself every day but Monday. But at least I don’t have to wash any windows or clean any floors and there’s nobody there’s nothing here to eat so I’m not tempted to have my face. What job is good for is paying for Kris and Kate‘s braces when they get them in December or January. I really didn’t intend to take a job like this – but the opportunity was too good to pass up. And if I want a bigger challenge or a bigger salary, I still have plenty of time left during the day to look.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Matthew 17th birthday so we had a big birthday dinner and a cherry pie for dessert. He has a job now at a rather fancy retirement home. He started bussing, but now he’s a waiter – – – he looks very nice in his formal waiters attire. He works Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. </p>
<p>By the way, tell Amy happy birthday for us – – – there has been so much going on around here in the days go by without noticing much but the essentials.</p>
<p>Scotty [cat] seems to have adjusted pretty well. Did I tell you that when we go back from our first trip to Texas, When we got back from our first trip to Texas, Toffee was sick; has feline urological syndrome, and now has to be on a special scientific diet. Surely with all of your cats have had this happen. How do you keep the other cats from eating the special food – – How do you keep the fus cat from eating the regular food? It’s a good thing Rob, my boss is not paying me to type. It’s been a long time and typewriters are so different now – – better but different.</p>
<p>I know there are other things I had to say, but I can’t think of right now. Walt, Matthew and Kate are all home sick today. Walt and Matthew have bad cold and Kate has a stomachache. It’s funny that they are all sick – – usually nobody is. I ran in the Portland marathon – not the marathon part; but the 5 mile run on Sunday with my kiiwi friend Jackie. She’s going to go back to New Zealand soon. I’ll miss her and will also have to find someone else to run with.</p>
<p>Love Pat</p>
<p>the phone rang four times in four hours and once it was Kate.  busy office

Dear Eve,</p>
<p>Sorry I haven’t written but we’ve been really busy. It is great to be back in Austin in some ways it’s like we never left. </p>
<p>We are cramped up in a small rental house at the moment – Walt rented it because of the tree – a huge live oak – is in the middle of the house , it shades the whole lot. That is the best feature of the house. We have put an offer on the house down the hill – but won’t move in until summer. I also got a job. I work from 9:30 to 2:30 – the job just fell into my lap on election day at the polls. We are all coming up this weekend so we’ll fill you in on all the details.</p>
